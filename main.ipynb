The staff were incredibly hospitable and welcoming, ready to help in any way we needed. We arrived early the day of our check-in and we were granted access to our room hours ahead of the 3PM guaranteed check-in time. We were welcomed with a lovely complimentary bottle of champagne and French chocolate. Housekeeping visited multiple times throughout the day, ensuring that our room stayed tidy. We included the breakfast buffet with our booking and looked forward to the delicious breakfast each morning.
