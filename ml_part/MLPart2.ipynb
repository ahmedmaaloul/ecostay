I love that Crowne Plaza hotels cook omelettes to your liking and their pancakes are freshly made, not too sweet and nice and fluffy. Their fruit juice selection is freshly squeezed with pulp still evident and not reconstituted cordial. They provided ironing facilities in the room too. \\nOur room was suitable for the Accessibility impaired, and therefore was large and spacious and had high ceilings, which we loved, however that meant the bathroom was less luxurious with no counter space and water splashed everywhere.\\nA common room with coin operated laundromats would always be welcome, as they are impossible to find amongst hotels in Europe. In fact, the Crowne Plaza hotel in Australia in Hunter Valley, Lovedale provides a communal coin operated laundromat.\\n\\nIt was ok\\nThe fact that I check out a day earlier than my original reservation and I was not reimbursed for the day I did use the hotel. That for me was unfair considering that I have been in there previous hotels and booked the next one through booking.com, so I'm a regular user of your platform and that should be taken into account.\\n\\nproximity to metropolitan and quiet at night\\nproximity to republic square which saw congregations of groups of people lost evenings which were quite intimidating (especially for the kids)\\n\\ngood breakfast, clean and comfortable\\nUber cars not allowed outside the hotel, ok with normal taxis. no USB charge point in bedroom\\n\\nBreakfast was excellent. Varied choices, tables cleared quickly, food stocks replenished promptly\\nThere were no drawers for clothes in the room and nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. Water pressure in the shower was weak.\\n\\ngood location, very polite staff\\n\\nHelpful staff\\nNot applicable\\n\\nfriendly staff and good location The breakfast was good and the location was close to many amenities.\\nthere was no swimming pool\\n\\nBreakfast really good. Working area great\\nNothing to complain about\\n\\nThe hotel is in an ideal location plenty of restaurants, cafes etc in the Republicque area. All the staff we spoke to in the hotel were so lovely. Hotel clean..honestly i couldn't fault the room we stayed in or the restaurant Great breakfast choice. If you dont mind a good walk to the louvres , eifel tower etc it takes about 40 + minutes and it's enjoyable to see the surroundings. If im honest i would advise to get taxi back to the hotel if you spend day sightseeing near tower, cruise etc as you will enjoy your evening meal locally.\\nNothing really as the hotel was lovely. If you don't mind being a little bit outside where the eifel tower is etc the hotel is perfect as we enjoyed the 40 minute walk to the louvre.\\n\\nGreat staff. Offered me a free upgrade for the room with complementary drink as a honeymoon gift. They were helpful with luggage & restaurants reservations.\\nRoom's furniture was a bit old (but very clean and neat)\\n\\nEverything was perfect!!! The hotel was next to a Metro station that served many different train lines. The location was close to everything ( Marais next to us ) and at any time felt quite safe. We recommend it to famillies.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe breakfast is exceptional\\nFacilitiesThe hotel is advertised as 4star hotel, but its far from it , it's 3 stars at most\\n\\nAt first we got a room on 4th floor with 2 small windows under the ceiling. After complaining we got nice room with big window as it is on the pictures. Helpful and nice stuff, comfortable beds, great breakfast with variety of foods.\\nThere should be more hangers for towels in the bathroom. Sometimes at the breakfast some foods were not fresh - corn, friuts and fruit salads.\\n\\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole stay.\\n\\nLocation,clean\\nRoom is very small\\n\\nThe buffet breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of foods to suit all tastes. The hotel was very central with a metro station entrance just beside it. The staff were really pleasant and very helpful.\\n\\nSituated in a very noisey location, could not sleep at all with sirens passing by every few minutes.\\n\\neverything\\nThe attitude of the some of the staff. The cleaner and the person at the reception\\n\\nBreakfast was amazing!! Enjoyed our suite with our family! Loved the metro being right outside of the hotel.

Clean.\\nRoom for 4 is actually too small for 4. Next time I would not buy breakfast and instead have it at any of the bars or bakeries around the corner. Breakfast is not worth the money.\\n\\ngreat location, accessible to all locations from Repablique Metro station (Ave de Republique exit) just a few metres away from the hotel. very friendly staff. Lots of great restaurants around the area. The food in the hotel restaurant is also excellent.\\nthe rooms are small. but that's expected of Paris.\\n\\nAs far as Paris goes, location was good. Right next to a metro station\\nThe hotel is situated in a busy area. There was a lot of traffic noise, sirens, horns etc both late at night and early morning.\\n\\nFound the staff in all areas very helpful and friendly. There was a good brisk, efficient working atmosphere. Bight and clean environment. Breakfast had good variety.\\nI was concerned to see a young boy using the rather sharp knife for the parma ham! \\n\\nI'm afraid my biggest gripe is that on looking at my invoice en route to the airport I was shocked to see I had been charged for ordering taxis. First off we only ordered a taxi for two outings and when presented ourselves on time for them only to be told none available and had to go out on the street to hail one down! I also tipped the concierge - I'm angry to have been charged \\u20ac23.04 for asking for taxi - we should have been informed before hand there was a charge. It left a v sour taste after a nice break in an otherwise well run hotel - just smacked of gouging!\\n\\nThe location was perfect, view outside of window was amazing!\\nThe scents of the body lotion, shampoo, wash etc didn\\u2019t smell that nice.\\n\\nA good location, fair price, good restaurant\\nNo access to Wifi in our part of the building. Requested helped and was told someone was looking into it. The issue was never resolved.\\n\\nThe building was beautiful and the location was fantastic.\\nNothing in particular\\n\\nlocation - plenty of choice for eating around the lively square and metro station very close. \\nroom - very spacious suite. best ever sofa bed! \\nbreakfast - fabulous selection. \\nstaff - very friendly and helpful\\nonly complaint was thought the exec lounge needs relocating.

It is very large and could have easily been divided for hotel guest usage and rental usage, but we were not able to use it at all those nights.\\n\\ngood location. big room and we had wet room bathroom which was huge. great breakfast and helpful staff. temple area is worth exploring\\nnothing really\\n\\nlovely bar and great breakfast. staff were excellent.\\n\\nlocation excellent,\\nroom had no cupboards and insufficient hanging space. room very small\\n\\nGreat feel when you first arrive, very stylish and welcoming, staff very friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast\\nlunch options pricey and limited.\\n\\nLocation was great.

Lifts worked well and room was quiet.\\nBreakfast was good but staffing was inadequate. Tables weren\\u2019t cleared, crockery ran out and when someone asked to have a table cleared we heard the member of staff that they only had 4 staff to cater for 450 clients\\n\\nThe location was good\\nIt is very expensive for what you get. Additionally the breakfast was not very impressive for the price. The rooms are old and tiny.\\n\\nlocation\\nsofa beds were not comfortable\\n\\nThis is a standard corporate business hotel with a fantastic location and good value. For Paris standards, the hotel room is relatively larger than most hotel rooms in the city and the rooms are clean, have air conditioning, and have been recently renovated. It's a big hotel with lots of activity (tourists and conventions), so it's hard to experience personalized service.\\n\\nThe location of the hotel is prime and super convenient. The metro is just outside the hotel and Republique is a major metro hub. It's also very close to the desirable arrondisments of the Marais, Canal Martin etc.\\nWe asked for a quiet room, but our request was not accommodated. We got a room that faced the square....althought I will say, the windows are double pane and blocked out most of the noise.\\n\\nThe hotel is very well located\\nThe breakfast could be better and the staff could be friendlier. A shame that you feel like that you are disturbing them. Only Laure-Line and Sami were amazing !\\n\\nwe like that the rooms were very spacious and clean\\nthe area is a little noisy\\n\\nRoom was fine, front desk personal was very helpful & extremely nice!\\n\\nlocation was perfect.\\nthe room while comfortable was a bit run down and not enough closet space.\\n\\nlocation and generous room size\\nroom a little run-down, roof terras very nice but could be greener\\n\\nThe staff was wonderful. They were very helpful and prompt.\\nThe music festival that was held outside in the large square. It went until 2 pm.\\n\\nwell maintained. great location. air conditioning is not U.S. standard. the room was warm with the coldest setting. 78 degrees.\\nair conditioning is not U.S. standard.\\n\\nlocation\\nVery, very bad internet\\nThe last two nights with out condition air and no body did something about it\\n\\nVery close to the metro.\\nOur room was at the front of the hotel and it was loud at night.\\n\\nBreakfast and location\\nStaff in the restaurant was not providing best servuce: very long waiting time, bread brought was not fresh and a piece was dropped on the table and put back to basket by the waitress, etc ..\\n\\nLocation, good breakfast.\\nA little noisy\\n\\nWas super! The kids loved it so much!\\n\\nThe staff didn't know I was a rewards member. They didn't offer any of the membership benefits when I was checking in until I told them I was a Diamond member.\\n\\ncentra\\nnothing\\n\\nThe hotel is well located.\\nMy room was noisy and the customer service level extremely poor. Basic requests were set with an immediate no ( like an additional 30 mins for check out) also room amenities are extremely basic ( broken hair dryer and useless iron)\\n\\nHotel was situated in a great location! Republique Square is a very central point, where all subway lines meet and you can mainly get transferred anywhere in the city. Lounge area downstairs was really well designed, with an amazing bar and lots of tables to accommodate plenty of visitors and guests. Breakfast was also very good!\\nAlso after an online request to give us a room with a view, they tried their best and gave us a room with partial view of the Eiffel Tower. I thank them for that!\\nRooms are not too big and even though updated, they are not brand new. They changed few things within the room, to give it a more fresh vibe (like linens and some design pillows), but some pieces scream outdated. Carpet on the floor is a Huge No from me as well as the entry piece where the coffee machine and closet are placed. This built in furniture it's like it's forgotten from the 80's. Even though we paid for a deluxe double room, the room didn't seem like one. Overall the hotel lounge and lobby are completely renovated, but the rooms are not.\\n\\nBreakfast was fantastic. Location was excellent, we love this area and always stay in the area when in paris.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nBreakfast was perfect plenty of choice\\n\\nBreakfast was great. Location is very nice. Metro access is very close and there are lots of restaurants nearby.\\nThe fridge and the aircon in the room were not working. Some areas of the room and in the passages need maintenance.\\n\\nlocation, room, breakfast, staff\\n\\nClean, Suite was spacious, beds comfortable, location convenient. We were very comfortable so decided to stay longer.\\nWhen wanting to extend our stay reception directed us to go online and book it rather than process it for us. Club lounge not enough seats or food options.\\n\\nThe breakfast was complete, location was excellent.\\nWhen we asked for a plate and spoon in our room we were told it would be an additional charge.\\n\\nAlso we had to change our room as it was too hot.\\n\\nlocation was excellent\\nseemed to cater to large groups,\\n\\nPerfect location. Close to Metro station, 1 minute. The restaurant for breakfast is open until 11 a.m. in the weekend.\\nNo mini bar, old bathroom, small room for family - 2 adults and 2 kids.\\n\\nlocation was fantastic- metro just outside the door! Lots of family friendly restaurants around the square We loved the ping pong table on the terrace\\nbathroom\\u2019s a little dated, cracked tiles etc, breakfast wasn\\u2019t included in room price\\n\\ntop location. 3 stops with the metro to the city centre.\\n\\nLovely stay and a very friendly staff.\\n\\nShower could be better\\n\\nGood, relatively for Paris, comfortable big rooms.\\nBathroom is also very comfortable with a big bath. Very good and tasty breakfast with a big veriery of dishes. \\nLocation very near a main metro station. \\nStaff is very helpful and friendly\\nLocation on the republique square can be problematic sometimes. There are many demonstartions and police presence which cause discomfort when going out\\n\\nFabulous breakfast, wide range of choices including freshly cooked omelettes! Luggage storage was useful. Staff were all really helpful and welcoming giving recommendations for dinner etc.\\nOne of the reasons for booking this hotel was the fitness room but it was very small and could only really accommodate a couple of users at once. There was an outdoor table tennis table but no bats. More teabags/milk as standard in the room (only 2 provided) would be a nice touch.\\n\\nSpacious rooms, friendly staff\\nExec lounge a bit basic, hotel toilets a bit of a mess, couldn\\u2019t change language on TV\\n\\nThe breakfast was delicious and a special thank you to the chef who made the omelettes.\\nMy room was quite far from the lift.\\n\\nNice hotel, good bed, nice general areas\\nshower simple, you should expect a rain shower \\nroom was at the square side; direct above a podium for a manifestation with a lot (really) a lot of noice.. music, loud speakers.. hotel should have advise me upfront or give the choice for another location in the hotel\\n\\nStaff were nice and helpful.\\nIt can be noisy but that's the location.\\n\\nGreat location in the hart of the city next to metro, Excellent restaurants in walking distance. The rooms are not spoiling you with style & comfort, but there is good bed, fast WiFi, Great housekeeping, everything in the room and in the building is very clean, Good bar & kitchen, providing large choice in breakfast.\\nNo IHG award points & nights if you book through booking.com\\n\\nnice location and staff to book trips\\nno vending machines \\nMonoprix grocery store few blocks away\\n\\nGood location, friendly staff and very comfortable\\nSeparate toilet without a sink, no mirror except in the bathroom\\n\\nA lot of extra services and very comprehensive staff!\\n\\nGood location on R\\u00e9publique Square, just to metro station\\nThe service is not at a high level. The restaurant for a breakfast opened from 7 o'clock, which is strange for a business trip. There are better 4 star hotels in Paris\\n\\nLocation was great a few steps from the metro. 3 stops and 5 minutes from Gare du Nord. The entrance is through the archway. Bed room was largest I have had in Paris. Quality great. Free water every day. A few metro stops to Ile de Paris and quite easy to Eiffel Tour too and Sacre Coeur. Nice modern bar with food and views of square. Supermarkets to left and left and bar with breakfast to right and right for 7 Euros. Good choice of restaurants on the square. Interesting to see all the different protests\\nBreakfast was 15 euro prebooked or 25 on the day.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast included in the room rate, although I did not like the coffee at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\\nThe room was very small. There was very little space for our luggage.\\n\\nFriendly staff. Centrally located.\\nNo on-site parking\\n\\nlocation, having a gym and size of the rooms are great. and the breakfast is good too. the bar lost a bit of its appeal...its too bright now. lights could be dimmed down to make it cosier for a night drink.\\nthe hotel has become a bit expensive and forcing you to be charged in advance when could just have the first night guaranteed could be a better option for guests.\\n\\ngood location, nice staff\\ncould use some renovation, windows/balcony dirty\\n\\nParking is not easy...., breakfast, location and room great. Shower only point.\\nShower\\n\\nEven on a busy morning breakfast ran very smoothly.\\nIt might have been the Covid restrictions still in place, but the bar closed early at night.\\n\\nThe cleaning staff was nice\\nI recently had a disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza, where I spent two weeks. Unfortunately, the internet connection in my room was consistently poor, forcing me to relocate to the lobby cafe to work.\\n\\nHowever, my experience at the cafe was equally frustrating. The staff frequently interrupted me during Zoom meetings, insisting that I make a purchase. As a business traveler relying on a stable and quiet workspace, I found this to be unacceptable.\\n\\nGiven the subpar internet and unwelcoming cafe atmosphere, I'm unlikely to return to this hotel. For the price point, I expect a more professional and accommodating environment. There are certainly better options available.\\n\\nRoom was excellent, location was fantastic and the breakfast was amazing\\nNothing\\n\\nSleep\\nAsked for courtyard room, confirmed at checkin, given a streetside room. No coffee maker in room, instant only.\\n\\njust breakfast\\nEVERYTHING \\nthe staff has no knowledge about whereabouts \\nwrong directions.\\ndidn't have any heat all over the stay.\\nthe room rugs were worn out \\nworn out decor and wall papers .\\nCamille the Assistant reception manger was just teying ro be nice so that we dont complain but did nothing about the Heat \\nthe night auditors were very rude and arrogant.\\nthe lady at the reception on our check out day had no sense of direction and gave us wrong itinerary.\\nAll together BAD EXPERIENCE\\n\\nThey were incredibly accommodating with our pets!\\nN/A we liked everything\\n\\nperfect location as there are shops, cafes and places to eat right outside the hotel.

We had a wonderful breakfast experience every day of our 7 day stay. We would like to mention how kind and sweet Joice was to my husband and I always greeting us with a smile.\\nThe location of the Hotel was perfect.\\nThe hotel rooms are small and would have been more comfortable if larger and dresser to unpack our clothes away.\\n\\nEverything- great location, service and experience!\\nN/A\\n\\nVery nice hotel and staff.\\nGrumpy bar tender\\n\\nclean\\nservices , drinks and food too expensive\\n\\nBreakfast was good. Location:noisy\\n\\nlocation. Friendly staff\\ncleanliness of the toilet. The sink in the shower is clogged and hair gathers on the floor. \\ni was misled by the publicity photo of a hotel housed in a grand building, but it lacks a proper entrance and the inside decor is like a YMCA property. The gym is too small.\\n\\nLocation, safety, quiet\\nAir conditioner wasn\\u2019t working, the room smelled of cigarettes, the bathroom drain was clogged, there were no amenities.\\n\\nWell located a short walk from the train station\\nRoom was not even close to those shown on the booking page. We got a disabled room for a romantic break that was tiny with the bathroom taking up the majority of the room. Bed was uncomfortable, outside was very noisy at night with one evening someone having the horn on none stop for 5 minutes at 4:20am. \\nBreakfast was the best point of the stay as we decided to spend the vast majority of our time away from the room. One meal in the hotel we had was very poor, hummus made with sesame oil was barely edible and the poke bowl was only just better. \\nRoom was dated and no coffee machine in a 4* hotel I was not sure still existed. \\n\\nOverpriced and certainly not 4* by some measure. Wont be back.\\n\\nThe location was fantastic. It\\u2019s within 50 m of the R\\u00e9publique Metro station and that has a number of metro lines to help you get to anywhere quickly. Breakfast was exceptional with something for everyone. Our rooms were very comfortable with excellent facilities. All staff were extremely friendly. Positioned on a rectangle with Place de la R\\u00e9publique in the centre, there were numerous bars and restaurants to sit and watch the world go by. We loved it!\\nIf I had to be picky, the only thing we didn\\u2019t like was the cost of the rooms and the cost of drinks and food at the hotel. However, this is an excellent hotel, in an excellent location, in Paris - so I wasn\\u2019t surprised at the expense.\\n\\nLocation\\nNothing\\n\\nBreakfast choices were fantastic - for all of the family. The location was great, right beside a metro station. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel was really clean. Staff were very friendly.\\nNothing.\\n\\nLarge hotel with reasonable amenities and good location\\nThe room was full of mosquitoes - I had to ask for it to be sprayed whilst we were out which improved it but only for one night- our whole family has mosquito bites from sleeping in the room - not what I expected for a 4 star expensive hotel- also the breakfast was advertised as being available at 6:30 but didn\\u2019t open til 7 which meant we couldn\\u2019t access it on our day of departure due to the early start to our day of travel despite having paid for it. Overall was ok but not what you should expect for a 4 star hotel in Paris.\\n\\nNot much to like.\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall). When I requested to change the room, they changed the room on the mezzanine floor, with windows to the sky. It is very bad filling when you arrive to the hotel and feel they lied from the first moment.\\nThere where mosquito in the room and we had to fight with them.\\nAt the and the most awful was that my 13 year old daughter\\u2019s shorts where lost/stolen. I talked to the r\\u00e9ception guys several times and no reaction. We knew that it was stolen on the 99% and they didn\\u2019t cared. On the last manager called and said that they were investigating and if it will not be found they will refund. But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nNot much to like\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall).

The family room was a great size, lots of space for 2 adults and 3 teenagers, and aircon worked well. There was a large courtyard terrace with outdoor games for the teens.\\nLovely hotel, no complaints\\n\\nLocation and room.\\nGreat bedroom with good crisp linen and comfortable mattress as well as a variety of pillows.\\nNothing to flag\\n\\nIt is in an amazing section of Paris with many restaurants. The R\\u00e9publique Metro station is right outside the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was such a time saver and had so many choices to get your day started. Also, the staff was so welcoming and friendly.\\nBecause of the Square right next to the hotel, don't expect it to be super quiet. Maybe some of the interior rooms would be more quiet. WIFI was also spotty in our room.\\n\\nPerfection\\nReally hard bed\\n\\nI had originally reserved one room with two large beds for my 2 daughters, one grandson and me. It worked out even better to have adjoining rooms, one with crib for the baby, one without. Location and comfort were very good. The receptionist who checked me out was kind, calm and professional, a warm send-off.\\nBased on my own experience, working in a 5-star hotel in Boston, I did not appreciate my initial check-in experience, before I realized a manager had modified my original reservation to the adjoining rooms. The receptionist made me feel like I had reserved 2 rooms, as if I'd made a mistake, 'that would be worked out later'. On my check-out morning, I also did not appreciate being made to feel like a criminal for bringing my 14-month-old grandson to the breakfast room before my daughter needed to leave to catch an early train. In general, I think a hotel of this caliber should not nickel & dime customers.\\n\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\n\\nGood location, close to different museums and historical places. Room spacious, clean and quiet. Good choices of food during breakfast.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Air Conditioning in the room did not work for the duration of our stay. After repeated complaints and requests a table fan was sent. This is not acceptable especially when paying for an Air conditioned room. Also, the exhaust in the bathroom did not work.\\n\\nNear metro\\nHow unsafe I felt we turned in daily by 7pm homeless people and daily protesting and rally\\u2019s were the norm across the street which lead to uncertainty with my safety and my children\\n\\nNot much\\nNoisy, basic, bad location, disturbed numerous times by wake up alarm that wasn\\u2019t requested at 3am and housekeeping trying to get us out way before check out\\n\\nI think that that\\u2019s the best my experience\\nNothing\\n\\nThe staff were kind and the breakfast was good.\\nThe distance from the elevator to the room was too long, Wi-Fi was weak.

Absolutely friendly and helpful front desk staff!\\n\\nPerfect location, very convenient for the use of metro. Great breakfast and clean&big rooms.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe location was perfect, metro right outside with lots of restaurants around. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Room was big, plenty of space for family of 4. We had a juliet balcony which was lovely. Breakfast was amazing, so fresh and delicious.\\nNothing, it was all great. \\nAlthough it's probably reasonable to note that Place de Republique is popular for protests and homelessness. We saw one protest and also on 2 evenings there was a food bank in the square. We didn't encounter any issues at all, and would go back to the same hotel again in the future.\\n\\nNice room great staff from cheakin to bar staff great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nWow! I was looking for somewhere nice for myself, husband and sons, somewhere near to Paris, a decent sized room. The room was large, clean and comfy. The staff were lovely!! Bonus fact, they uses this hotel in the TV series Modern Family when they came to Paris! The hotel has direct metro access to the front door, 20-30 mins into Paris.

And the prize goes to the breakfast (included in the price) in a super cocooning restaurant room, there is something for everyone, everything is delicious and fresh. We loved everything.

Even kids loved it. Staff were wonderful. Easy access to all locations via metro. Close to the Cirque d'Hiver which we loved.\\nThe heating in the room didn't work so the room was quite cold. When I called for assistance they sent us a heater which didn't work, so they had to send another one. Also, check in took a long time and kids were becoming impatient. Apparently there was a miscommunication between Booking.com and the hotel.\\n\\nGood room size for Paris. Nice lobby and bar area.\\nBreakfast is pretty bad - quality of food needs to improve. Add some mushrooms or vegetables to the hot buffet selection.\\n\\nGym / Fitness room is a joke with 3 machines. 2 people would struggle to do anything in there at the same time.

But, hey, Paris is expensive.\\n\\nIt is in a very central busy plaza with the metro right outside. The hotel has modern decor and is well serviced. The breakfast had an amazing array of foods it was lovely on the first day, but on the second, we came down later, and a lot of the options had not been replenished. \\nThe room was large with two double beds for the four of us.\\nThere was no view from the window as it faced a wall so quiet a dark room.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and very accommodating. Cleaning staff did a good job with the room everyday. Metro station entrance and exist is right outside of the hotel.\\nWhile the windows deafened most of the noise from the plaza directly outside, we still could hear people yelling in the plaza very early in the morning. Wouldn't call it a deal breaker though.\\n\\nStaff and location\\nLimited space in the room.\\nMediocre breakfast for Paris.\\n\\nFriendly and Accommodating Staff. Great Cleaning Service! The breakfast was delicious. Perfect location right next to the Metro for tourists. We even got a room upgrade!\\n\\nGreat location, good sized room for Paris\\nExpensive, like most accommodation in central Paris\\n\\nLocation, room size and service.\\nToo few electrical plugs, particularly no plug in the bathroom. The property was a bit too expansive- for about a total of $400 a night without being in the very center of Paris one should get a junior sweet. There were too few English language TV channels. The internet was completely open.\\n\\nLocated in a central area. Easy to walk to many places.

Staff, facilities and room were very good, with a comfy bed and spacious room. Breakfast was delish and had something for everyone. It attracts business, family and solo travellers. Easy walking distance to the Pompidou centre and Marais shopping and dining area.\\nPlace de la Republique is a busy area and can attract some protests but it wasn\\u2019t disruptive staying at the hotel.\\n\\nThe staff\\nNothing comes to mind\\n\\nRoom was good, as was location and breakfast\\nWhen leaving the breakfast table to get more food, came back and found the table completely cleared.\\n\\nThe location and price\\nFor reasons of hygiene, I didn't like that the rooms and corridors still have carpeted floors.\\n\\nGenerally It is good.Breakfast was excellent.

Some parts needs refurbishment for ex elevators.\\n\\nHotel staff were very helpful.\\n\\nrooms are big for Paris standart. We will stay again.\\n\\nI liked the lobby, the breakfast area, and the location. The staff was really polite and helpful.\\nThe initial room was terrible. It was in the second floor, internal and not sunny at all, and with a door which was supposed to connect with another room. We complained and they changed the room. They gave us one on the third floor with a view in the Plaza. I strongly recommend asking for a room with a view in the Plaza before booking!\\n\\nLovely old heritage hotel.

Right next to a Metro\\nA lot of running up and down the passageway one night.\\n\\nThe breakfast is very hearty, the service staff is very serious and enthusiastic, the transportation is very convenient, and the subway station is right outside the hotel door. I sometimes wake up in the morning to the sound of cars outside my window.\\nWindow sound insulation\\n\\ngood selection of breakfast and facilities\\nbasic baskets\\n\\nThe location is excellent, and also the staff! Breakfast is nice, variance of choices of food. We will stay here when come back to Paris in the future.\\nSound insulation is not very good.\\n\\nTerrific breakfast, as expected of Crowne Plaza hotels. I love that Crowne Plaza hotels cook omelettes to your liking and their pancakes are freshly made, not too sweet and nice and fluffy. Their fruit juice selection is freshly squeezed with pulp still evident and not reconstituted cordial. They provided ironing facilities in the room too. \\nOur room was suitable for the Accessibility impaired, and therefore was large and spacious and had high ceilings, which we loved, however that meant the bathroom was less luxurious with no counter space and water splashed everywhere.\\nA common room with coin operated laundromats would always be welcome, as they are impossible to find amongst hotels in Europe. In fact, the Crowne Plaza hotel in Australia in Hunter Valley, Lovedale provides a communal coin operated laundromat.\\n\\nIt was ok\\nThe fact that I check out a day earlier than my original reservation and I was not reimbursed for the day I did use the hotel. That for me was unfair considering that I have been in there previous hotels and booked the next one through booking.com, so I'm a regular user of your platform and that should be taken into account.\\n\\nproximity to metropolitan and quiet at night\\nproximity to republic square which saw congregations of groups of people lost evenings which were quite intimidating (especially for the kids)\\n\\ngood breakfast, clean and comfortable\\nUber cars not allowed outside the hotel, ok with normal taxis. no USB charge point in bedroom\\n\\nBreakfast was excellent. Varied choices, tables cleared quickly, food stocks replenished promptly\\nThere were no drawers for clothes in the room and nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom.

Working area great\\nNothing to complain about\\n\\nThe hotel is in an ideal location plenty of restaurants, cafes etc in the Republicque area. All the staff we spoke to in the hotel were so lovely. Hotel clean..honestly i couldn't fault the room we stayed in or the restaurant Great breakfast choice. If you dont mind a good walk to the louvres , eifel tower etc it takes about 40 + minutes and it's enjoyable to see the surroundings. If im honest i would advise to get taxi back to the hotel if you spend day sightseeing near tower, cruise etc as you will enjoy your evening meal locally.\\nNothing really as the hotel was lovely. If you don't mind being a little bit outside where the eifel tower is etc the hotel is perfect as we enjoyed the 40 minute walk to the louvre.\\n\\nGreat staff. Offered me a free upgrade for the room with complementary drink as a honeymoon gift. They were helpful with luggage & restaurants reservations.\\nRoom's furniture was a bit old (but very clean and neat)\\n\\nEverything was perfect!!! The hotel was next to a Metro station that served many different train lines. The location was close to everything ( Marais next to us ) and at any time felt quite safe. We recommend it to famillies.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe breakfast is exceptional\\nFacilitiesThe hotel is advertised as 4star hotel, but its far from it , it's 3 stars at most\\n\\nAt first we got a room on 4th floor with 2 small windows under the ceiling. After complaining we got nice room with big window as it is on the pictures. Helpful and nice stuff, comfortable beds, great breakfast with variety of foods.\\nThere should be more hangers for towels in the bathroom. Sometimes at the breakfast some foods were not fresh - corn, friuts and fruit salads.\\n\\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole stay.\\n\\nLocation,clean\\nRoom is very small\\n\\nThe buffet breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of foods to suit all tastes. The hotel was very central with a metro station entrance just beside it. The staff were really pleasant and very helpful.\\n\\nSituated in a very noisey location, could not sleep at all with sirens passing by every few minutes.\\n\\neverything\\nThe attitude of the some of the staff. The cleaner and the person at the reception\\n\\nBreakfast was amazing!! Enjoyed our suite with our family! Loved the metro being right outside of the hotel.

Clean.\\nRoom for 4 is actually too small for 4. Next time I would not buy breakfast and instead have it at any of the bars or bakeries around the corner. Breakfast is not worth the money.\\n\\ngreat location, accessible to all locations from Repablique Metro station (Ave de Republique exit) just a few metres away from the hotel. very friendly staff. Lots of great restaurants around the area. The food in the hotel restaurant is also excellent.\\nthe rooms are small. but that's expected of Paris.\\n\\nAs far as Paris goes, location was good. Right next to a metro station\\nThe hotel is situated in a busy area. There was a lot of traffic noise, sirens, horns etc both late at night and early morning.\\n\\nFound the staff in all areas very helpful and friendly. There was a good brisk, efficient working atmosphere. Bight and clean environment. Breakfast had good variety.\\nI was concerned to see a young boy using the rather sharp knife for the parma ham! \\n\\nI'm afraid my biggest gripe is that on looking at my invoice en route to the airport I was shocked to see I had been charged for ordering taxis. First off we only ordered a taxi for two outings and when presented ourselves on time for them only to be told none available and had to go out on the street to hail one down! I also tipped the concierge - I'm angry to have been charged \\u20ac23.04 for asking for taxi - we should have been informed before hand there was a charge. It left a v sour taste after a nice break in an otherwise well run hotel - just smacked of gouging!\\n\\nThe location was perfect, view outside of window was amazing!\\nThe scents of the body lotion, shampoo, wash etc didn\\u2019t smell that nice.\\n\\nA good location, fair price, good restaurant\\nNo access to Wifi in our part of the building. Requested helped and was told someone was looking into it. The issue was never resolved.\\n\\nThe building was beautiful and the location was fantastic.\\nNothing in particular\\n\\nlocation - plenty of choice for eating around the lively square and metro station very close. \\nroom - very spacious suite. best ever sofa bed! \\nbreakfast - fabulous selection. \\nstaff - very friendly and helpful\\nonly complaint was thought the exec lounge needs relocating.

It is very large and could have easily been divided for hotel guest usage and rental usage, but we were not able to use it at all those nights.\\n\\ngood location. big room and we had wet room bathroom which was huge. great breakfast and helpful staff. temple area is worth exploring\\nnothing really\\n\\nlovely bar and great breakfast. staff were excellent.\\n\\nlocation excellent,\\nroom had no cupboards and insufficient hanging space. room very small\\n\\nGreat feel when you first arrive, very stylish and welcoming, staff very friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast\\nlunch options pricey and limited.\\n\\nLocation was great. Breakfast was pretty good. Lobby bar was nice. Building was beautiful.\\nRoom was very small and bathroom was tiny. Coffee machine didn\\u2019t work. Room looked like it had really cheap fittings.

Tired bathroom\\n\\ngreat staff\\ngreat spacious room\\nclean hotel, clean room\\nnot a lot of choices at breakfast buffet\\nno snacks in the lounge room\\n\\nthe courtyard, the modern finished. the staff was AMAZING and went beyond expectations by moving our luggage to taxi while we finished breakfast.\\nthe beds were a little used\\n\\nReception staff were very helpful. Lifts worked well and room was quiet.\\nBreakfast was good but staffing was inadequate. Tables weren\\u2019t cleared, crockery ran out and when someone asked to have a table cleared we heard the member of staff that they only had 4 staff to cater for 450 clients\\n\\nThe location was good\\nIt is very expensive for what you get. Additionally the breakfast was not very impressive for the price. The rooms are old and tiny.\\n\\nlocation\\nsofa beds were not comfortable\\n\\nThis is a standard corporate business hotel with a fantastic location and good value. For Paris standards, the hotel room is relatively larger than most hotel rooms in the city and the rooms are clean, have air conditioning, and have been recently renovated. It's a big hotel with lots of activity (tourists and conventions), so it's hard to experience personalized service.\\n\\nThe location of the hotel is prime and super convenient. The metro is just outside the hotel and Republique is a major metro hub. It's also very close to the desirable arrondisments of the Marais, Canal Martin etc.\\nWe asked for a quiet room, but our request was not accommodated. We got a room that faced the square....althought I will say, the windows are double pane and blocked out most of the noise.\\n\\nThe hotel is very well located\\nThe breakfast could be better and the staff could be friendlier. A shame that you feel like that you are disturbing them. Only Laure-Line and Sami were amazing !\\n\\nwe like that the rooms were very spacious and clean\\nthe area is a little noisy\\n\\nRoom was fine, front desk personal was very helpful & extremely nice!\\n\\nlocation was perfect.\\nthe room while comfortable was a bit run down and not enough closet space.\\n\\nlocation and generous room size\\nroom a little run-down, roof terras very nice but could be greener\\n\\nThe staff was wonderful. They were very helpful and prompt.\\nThe music festival that was held outside in the large square. It went until 2 pm.\\n\\nwell maintained. great location. air conditioning is not U.S. standard. the room was warm with the coldest setting. 78 degrees.\\nair conditioning is not U.S. standard.\\n\\nlocation\\nVery, very bad internet\\nThe last two nights with out condition air and no body did something about it\\n\\nVery close to the metro.\\nOur room was at the front of the hotel and it was loud at night.\\n\\nBreakfast and location\\nStaff in the restaurant was not providing best servuce: very long waiting time, bread brought was not fresh and a piece was dropped on the table and put back to basket by the waitress, etc ..\\n\\nLocation, good breakfast.\\nA little noisy\\n\\nWas super! The kids loved it so much!\\n\\nThe staff didn't know I was a rewards member. They didn't offer any of the membership benefits when I was checking in until I told them I was a Diamond member.\\n\\ncentra\\nnothing\\n\\nThe hotel is well located.\\nMy room was noisy and the customer service level extremely poor. Basic requests were set with an immediate no ( like an additional 30 mins for check out) also room amenities are extremely basic ( broken hair dryer and useless iron)\\n\\nHotel was situated in a great location! Republique Square is a very central point, where all subway lines meet and you can mainly get transferred anywhere in the city. Lounge area downstairs was really well designed, with an amazing bar and lots of tables to accommodate plenty of visitors and guests. Breakfast was also very good!\\nAlso after an online request to give us a room with a view, they tried their best and gave us a room with partial view of the Eiffel Tower. I thank them for that!\\nRooms are not too big and even though updated, they are not brand new. They changed few things within the room, to give it a more fresh vibe (like linens and some design pillows), but some pieces scream outdated. Carpet on the floor is a Huge No from me as well as the entry piece where the coffee machine and closet are placed. This built in furniture it's like it's forgotten from the 80's. Even though we paid for a deluxe double room, the room didn't seem like one. Overall the hotel lounge and lobby are completely renovated, but the rooms are not.\\n\\nBreakfast was fantastic. Location was excellent, we love this area and always stay in the area when in paris.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nBreakfast was perfect plenty of choice\\n\\nBreakfast was great. Location is very nice. Metro access is very close and there are lots of restaurants nearby.\\nThe fridge and the aircon in the room were not working. Some areas of the room and in the passages need maintenance.\\n\\nlocation, room, breakfast, staff\\n\\nClean, Suite was spacious, beds comfortable, location convenient. We were very comfortable so decided to stay longer.\\nWhen wanting to extend our stay reception directed us to go online and book it rather than process it for us. Club lounge not enough seats or food options.\\n\\nThe breakfast was complete, location was excellent.\\nWhen we asked for a plate and spoon in our room we were told it would be an additional charge.\\n\\nAlso we had to change our room as it was too hot.\\n\\nlocation was excellent\\nseemed to cater to large groups,\\n\\nPerfect location. Close to Metro station, 1 minute. The restaurant for breakfast is open until 11 a.m. in the weekend.\\nNo mini bar, old bathroom, small room for family - 2 adults and 2 kids.\\n\\nlocation was fantastic- metro just outside the door! Lots of family friendly restaurants around the square We loved the ping pong table on the terrace\\nbathroom\\u2019s a little dated, cracked tiles etc, breakfast wasn\\u2019t included in room price\\n\\ntop location. 3 stops with the metro to the city centre.\\n\\nLovely stay and a very friendly staff.\\n\\nShower could be better\\n\\nGood, relatively for Paris, comfortable big rooms.\\nBathroom is also very comfortable with a big bath. Very good and tasty breakfast with a big veriery of dishes. \\nLocation very near a main metro station. \\nStaff is very helpful and friendly\\nLocation on the republique square can be problematic sometimes. There are many demonstartions and police presence which cause discomfort when going out\\n\\nFabulous breakfast, wide range of choices including freshly cooked omelettes! Luggage storage was useful. Staff were all really helpful and welcoming giving recommendations for dinner etc.\\nOne of the reasons for booking this hotel was the fitness room but it was very small and could only really accommodate a couple of users at once. There was an outdoor table tennis table but no bats. More teabags/milk as standard in the room (only 2 provided) would be a nice touch.\\n\\nSpacious rooms, friendly staff\\nExec lounge a bit basic, hotel toilets a bit of a mess, couldn\\u2019t change language on TV\\n\\nThe breakfast was delicious and a special thank you to the chef who made the omelettes.\\nMy room was quite far from the lift.\\n\\nNice hotel, good bed, nice general areas\\nshower simple, you should expect a rain shower \\nroom was at the square side; direct above a podium for a manifestation with a lot (really) a lot of noice.. music, loud speakers.. hotel should have advise me upfront or give the choice for another location in the hotel\\n\\nStaff were nice and helpful.\\nIt can be noisy but that's the location.\\n\\nGreat location in the hart of the city next to metro, Excellent restaurants in walking distance. The rooms are not spoiling you with style & comfort, but there is good bed, fast WiFi, Great housekeeping, everything in the room and in the building is very clean, Good bar & kitchen, providing large choice in breakfast.\\nNo IHG award points & nights if you book through booking.com\\n\\nnice location and staff to book trips\\nno vending machines \\nMonoprix grocery store few blocks away\\n\\nGood location, friendly staff and very comfortable\\nSeparate toilet without a sink, no mirror except in the bathroom\\n\\nA lot of extra services and very comprehensive staff!\\n\\nGood location on R\\u00e9publique Square, just to metro station\\nThe service is not at a high level. The restaurant for a breakfast opened from 7 o'clock, which is strange for a business trip. There are better 4 star hotels in Paris\\n\\nLocation was great a few steps from the metro. 3 stops and 5 minutes from Gare du Nord. The entrance is through the archway. Bed room was largest I have had in Paris. Quality great. Free water every day. A few metro stops to Ile de Paris and quite easy to Eiffel Tour too and Sacre Coeur. Nice modern bar with food and views of square. Supermarkets to left and left and bar with breakfast to right and right for 7 Euros. Good choice of restaurants on the square. Interesting to see all the different protests\\nBreakfast was 15 euro prebooked or 25 on the day.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast included in the room rate, although I did not like the coffee at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\\nThe room was very small. There was very little space for our luggage.\\n\\nFriendly staff. Centrally located.\\nNo on-site parking\\n\\nlocation, having a gym and size of the rooms are great. and the breakfast is good too. the bar lost a bit of its appeal...its too bright now. lights could be dimmed down to make it cosier for a night drink.\\nthe hotel has become a bit expensive and forcing you to be charged in advance when could just have the first night guaranteed could be a better option for guests.\\n\\ngood location, nice staff\\ncould use some renovation, windows/balcony dirty\\n\\nParking is not easy...., breakfast, location and room great. Shower only point.\\nShower\\n\\nEven on a busy morning breakfast ran very smoothly.\\nIt might have been the Covid restrictions still in place, but the bar closed early at night.\\n\\nThe cleaning staff was nice\\nI recently had a disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza, where I spent two weeks. Unfortunately, the internet connection in my room was consistently poor, forcing me to relocate to the lobby cafe to work.\\n\\nHowever, my experience at the cafe was equally frustrating. The staff frequently interrupted me during Zoom meetings, insisting that I make a purchase. As a business traveler relying on a stable and quiet workspace, I found this to be unacceptable.\\n\\nGiven the subpar internet and unwelcoming cafe atmosphere, I'm unlikely to return to this hotel. For the price point, I expect a more professional and accommodating environment. There are certainly better options available.\\n\\nRoom was excellent, location was fantastic and the breakfast was amazing\\nNothing\\n\\nSleep\\nAsked for courtyard room, confirmed at checkin, given a streetside room. No coffee maker in room, instant only.\\n\\njust breakfast\\nEVERYTHING \\nthe staff has no knowledge about whereabouts \\nwrong directions.\\ndidn't have any heat all over the stay.\\nthe room rugs were worn out \\nworn out decor and wall papers .\\nCamille the Assistant reception manger was just teying ro be nice so that we dont complain but did nothing about the Heat \\nthe night auditors were very rude and arrogant.\\nthe lady at the reception on our check out day had no sense of direction and gave us wrong itinerary.\\nAll together BAD EXPERIENCE\\n\\nThey were incredibly accommodating with our pets!\\nN/A we liked everything\\n\\nperfect location as there are shops, cafes and places to eat right outside the hotel. Also there is a metro station right outside\\ni think it is a bit overpriced\\n\\nThe Location and the the breakfast\\nCheck in and the checkout policy\\n\\nHotel is in a great location for both walking and taking the Metro. \\nThe daily breakfast was a perfect way to start the morning.\\nEveryone was so nice and accommodating.\\nHighly recommend.\\nWe liked everything.\\n\\nGreat location, warm, modern with old world charm. Breakfast was good, the restaurant staff at breakfast were very attentive.\\nComfortable beds, warm rooms.\\n\\nThe breakfast was absolutely lovely.\\nEverything was fresh and very delicious. \\nThe Staff at the restaurant were very friendly and attentive. We had a wonderful breakfast experience every day of our 7 day stay. We would like to mention how kind and sweet Joice was to my husband and I always greeting us with a smile.\\nThe location of the Hotel was perfect.\\nThe hotel rooms are small and would have been more comfortable if larger and dresser to unpack our clothes away.\\n\\nEverything- great location, service and experience!\\nN/A\\n\\nVery nice hotel and staff.\\nGrumpy bar tender\\n\\nclean\\nservices , drinks and food too expensive\\n\\nBreakfast was good. Location:noisy\\n\\nlocation. Friendly staff\\ncleanliness of the toilet. The sink in the shower is clogged and hair gathers on the floor. \\ni was misled by the publicity photo of a hotel housed in a grand building, but it lacks a proper entrance and the inside decor is like a YMCA property. The gym is too small.\\n\\nLocation, safety, quiet\\nAir conditioner wasn\\u2019t working, the room smelled of cigarettes, the bathroom drain was clogged, there were no amenities.\\n\\nWell located a short walk from the train station\\nRoom was not even close to those shown on the booking page. We got a disabled room for a romantic break that was tiny with the bathroom taking up the majority of the room. Bed was uncomfortable, outside was very noisy at night with one evening someone having the horn on none stop for 5 minutes at 4:20am. \\nBreakfast was the best point of the stay as we decided to spend the vast majority of our time away from the room. One meal in the hotel we had was very poor, hummus made with sesame oil was barely edible and the poke bowl was only just better. \\nRoom was dated and no coffee machine in a 4* hotel I was not sure still existed. \\n\\nOverpriced and certainly not 4* by some measure. Wont be back.\\n\\nThe location was fantastic. It\\u2019s within 50 m of the R\\u00e9publique Metro station and that has a number of metro lines to help you get to anywhere quickly. Breakfast was exceptional with something for everyone. Our rooms were very comfortable with excellent facilities. All staff were extremely friendly. Positioned on a rectangle with Place de la R\\u00e9publique in the centre, there were numerous bars and restaurants to sit and watch the world go by. We loved it!\\nIf I had to be picky, the only thing we didn\\u2019t like was the cost of the rooms and the cost of drinks and food at the hotel. However, this is an excellent hotel, in an excellent location, in Paris - so I wasn\\u2019t surprised at the expense.\\n\\nLocation\\nNothing\\n\\nBreakfast choices were fantastic - for all of the family. The location was great, right beside a metro station. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel was really clean. Staff were very friendly.\\nNothing.\\n\\nLarge hotel with reasonable amenities and good location\\nThe room was full of mosquitoes - I had to ask for it to be sprayed whilst we were out which improved it but only for one night- our whole family has mosquito bites from sleeping in the room - not what I expected for a 4 star expensive hotel- also the breakfast was advertised as being available at 6:30 but didn\\u2019t open til 7 which meant we couldn\\u2019t access it on our day of departure due to the early start to our day of travel despite having paid for it. Overall was ok but not what you should expect for a 4 star hotel in Paris.\\n\\nNot much to like.\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall). When I requested to change the room, they changed the room on the mezzanine floor, with windows to the sky. It is very bad filling when you arrive to the hotel and feel they lied from the first moment.\\nThere where mosquito in the room and we had to fight with them.\\nAt the and the most awful was that my 13 year old daughter\\u2019s shorts where lost/stolen. I talked to the r\\u00e9ception guys several times and no reaction. We knew that it was stolen on the 99% and they didn\\u2019t cared. On the last manager called and said that they were investigating and if it will not be found they will refund. But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nNot much to like\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall).

The family room was a great size, lots of space for 2 adults and 3 teenagers, and aircon worked well. There was a large courtyard terrace with outdoor games for the teens.\\nLovely hotel, no complaints\\n\\nLocation and room.\\nGreat bedroom with good crisp linen and comfortable mattress as well as a variety of pillows.\\nNothing to flag\\n\\nIt is in an amazing section of Paris with many restaurants. The R\\u00e9publique Metro station is right outside the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was such a time saver and had so many choices to get your day started. Also, the staff was so welcoming and friendly.\\nBecause of the Square right next to the hotel, don't expect it to be super quiet. Maybe some of the interior rooms would be more quiet. WIFI was also spotty in our room.\\n\\nPerfection\\nReally hard bed\\n\\nI had originally reserved one room with two large beds for my 2 daughters, one grandson and me. It worked out even better to have adjoining rooms, one with crib for the baby, one without. Location and comfort were very good. The receptionist who checked me out was kind, calm and professional, a warm send-off.\\nBased on my own experience, working in a 5-star hotel in Boston, I did not appreciate my initial check-in experience, before I realized a manager had modified my original reservation to the adjoining rooms. The receptionist made me feel like I had reserved 2 rooms, as if I'd made a mistake, 'that would be worked out later'. On my check-out morning, I also did not appreciate being made to feel like a criminal for bringing my 14-month-old grandson to the breakfast room before my daughter needed to leave to catch an early train. In general, I think a hotel of this caliber should not nickel & dime customers.\\n\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\n\\nGood location, close to different museums and historical places. Room spacious, clean and quiet. Good choices of food during breakfast.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Air Conditioning in the room did not work for the duration of our stay. After repeated complaints and requests a table fan was sent. This is not acceptable especially when paying for an Air conditioned room. Also, the exhaust in the bathroom did not work.\\n\\nNear metro\\nHow unsafe I felt we turned in daily by 7pm homeless people and daily protesting and rally\\u2019s were the norm across the street which lead to uncertainty with my safety and my children\\n\\nNot much\\nNoisy, basic, bad location, disturbed numerous times by wake up alarm that wasn\\u2019t requested at 3am and housekeeping trying to get us out way before check out\\n\\nI think that that\\u2019s the best my experience\\nNothing\\n\\nThe staff were kind and the breakfast was good.\\nThe distance from the elevator to the room was too long, Wi-Fi was weak.

Room was big, plenty of space for family of 4. We had a juliet balcony which was lovely. Breakfast was amazing, so fresh and delicious.\\nNothing, it was all great. \\nAlthough it's probably reasonable to note that Place de Republique is popular for protests and homelessness. We saw one protest and also on 2 evenings there was a food bank in the square. We didn't encounter any issues at all, and would go back to the same hotel again in the future.\\n\\nNice room great staff from cheakin to bar staff great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nWow! I was looking for somewhere nice for myself, husband and sons, somewhere near to Paris, a decent sized room. The room was large, clean and comfy. The staff were lovely!! Bonus fact, they uses this hotel in the TV series Modern Family when they came to Paris! The hotel has direct metro access to the front door, 20-30 mins into Paris. Get the navigo cards to travel, cheap and efficient. Each card can have 10 trips on and you can \\\"recharge\\\" them for more. They're a bit like oyster cards and can be got at the stations. The food at The Dix in the hotel was amazing!

By far the best staff at any hotel I\\u2019ve stayed at\\n\\nRooms are a good size, beds and pillows comfortable\\nThe area was a little rough and so much noise as our room faced the street. First night students protesting/rioting, next couple of nights the homeless and junkies screaming and fighting at 3am. \\nRooms are tired and outdated, bathrooms too. \\nFound breakfast a little poor and the bar/restaurant had no kids menu/meals etc \\nI think it\\u2019s a little overpriced for what you get but I guess that\\u2019s Paris\\n\\nLocation only\\n- the mattress of room 390 was too soft and oldish\\n- spider webs on the roof\\n- cabinet tremendously old\\n\\nFirstly, we got given a room with marks all over the wall, a broken blind that would not open, a broken TV and lamp.

Really well located.\\nWe absolutely wanted an air-conditioned hotel. This one was indicated as being. Arriving late in the evening, we were surprised by the heat that reigned in the hall. In the room that had windows overlooking the interior patio, it was worse. When we wanted to turn on the air conditioning, we noticed that it was not cold at all. On the contrary, the air blown is hot. We try to fall asleep, without success. We end up calling reception. After making excuses that would have made you fall asleep standing up to explain the non-functioning such as \\\"these are mandatory environmental measures\\\" they lent us a fan with a built-in thermometer. The temperature indicated 26\\u00b0. The next day, we went to ask for an explanation. We were finally told that the instructions given by management were not to operate the air conditioning. Probably to save electricity. But this is unacceptable for an establishment that claims 4 stars. It is false information to present itself as an air-conditioned hotel. We spent 2 very bad nights sleeping badly. \\nAdded to this a very slow reception staff, a kind of latent \\\"I don't care\\\" attitude, a coffee machine that doesn't even work etc... \\nWe will never set foot in this hotel again.

And we were even upgraded to a suite.\\nSuper comfortable room, a real apartment, very pleasant bedding.\\nThe Crown Plaza is very well located for visiting Paris.\\nThe staff is great, the facilities and relaxation areas are great. And the prize goes to the breakfast (included in the price) in a super cocooning restaurant room, there is something for everyone, everything is delicious and fresh. We loved everything. Thank you\\nThe incivility of the other tourists in the hotel, who leave their rubbish in the corridor as if we were in a pigsty and the hotel staff were their maids or slaves. Where is the world going?\\n\\nthe common areas, breakfast\\nThe reception staff very unpleasant, unfortunately all the teams (morning and evening)... very very limited sense of welcome\\n\\nthe location\\nthe water flow in the shower, we had a trickle of water and barely warm\\n\\nThe central position and the family rooms\\nthe equipment that deserves a renovation\\n\\nsituation\\nroom almost not heated as well as the bathroom!!! we can reduce the heating in the hotel but there it was downright cold. on the other hand the reception and the bar well heated \\u2026\\u2026???????\\n\\nGreat location and friendly staff\\nNo\\n\\nVery close to the center, nice view, nice Buffett\\nNeeds some redecoration / maintenance\\nThey ask for security deposit during check in without prior information\\n\\nThe breakfast was excellent. Even kids loved it. Staff were wonderful. Easy access to all locations via metro. Close to the Cirque d'Hiver which we loved.\\nThe heating in the room didn't work so the room was quite cold. When I called for assistance they sent us a heater which didn't work, so they had to send another one. Also, check in took a long time and kids were becoming impatient. Apparently there was a miscommunication between Booking.com and the hotel.\\n\\nGood room size for Paris. Nice lobby and bar area.\\nBreakfast is pretty bad - quality of food needs to improve. Add some mushrooms or vegetables to the hot buffet selection.\\n\\nGym / Fitness room is a joke with 3 machines. 2 people would struggle to do anything in there at the same time. Maybe get a deal for day passes with gym next door. Literally nextdoor!\\n\\nHigh quality\\nWe had a quad room, very tight on space. However beds super comfortable\\n\\nThe breakfast was exceptional, with many varieties. \\nThe room was clean, the bathroom was spacious and modern.\\nThe location is superb, very close to the Metro.\\n\\nThe location\\nThe lady on reception said she was going to upgrade us, it was still a standard room\\n\\nBreakfast\\nYour lift.

But, hey, Paris is expensive.\\n\\nIt is in a very central busy plaza with the metro right outside. The hotel has modern decor and is well serviced. The breakfast had an amazing array of foods it was lovely on the first day, but on the second, we came down later, and a lot of the options had not been replenished. \\nThe room was large with two double beds for the four of us.\\nThere was no view from the window as it faced a wall so quiet a dark room.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and very accommodating. Cleaning staff did a good job with the room everyday. Metro station entrance and exist is right outside of the hotel.\\nWhile the windows deafened most of the noise from the plaza directly outside, we still could hear people yelling in the plaza very early in the morning. Wouldn't call it a deal breaker though.\\n\\nStaff and location\\nLimited space in the room.\\nMediocre breakfast for Paris.\\n\\nFriendly and Accommodating Staff. Great Cleaning Service! The breakfast was delicious. Perfect location right next to the Metro for tourists. We even got a room upgrade!\\n\\nGreat location, good sized room for Paris\\nExpensive, like most accommodation in central Paris\\n\\nLocation, room size and service.\\nToo few electrical plugs, particularly no plug in the bathroom. The property was a bit too expansive- for about a total of $400 a night without being in the very center of Paris one should get a junior sweet. There were too few English language TV channels. The internet was completely open.\\n\\nLocated in a central area. Easy to walk to many places. Clean and lovely court yard\\nStaff were super pleasant and very helpful\\nI didn\\u2019t know that I would be charged city taxes. Would have been helpful to have that information\\n\\nRight on the square\\u2014lots of activity and choices to eat\\nCan\\u2019t think of anything\\n\\nGreat location great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nbreakfast was amazing and staff were very helpful. Loved the view of the courtyard seeing the pop-up looking resturants and live size chess board. \\nWe loved that they had great restaurant recommendations and connections to get quick assess into the different restaurants\\nour first 2 nights the cleaning staff kept waking is up to clean the rooms, which on the 1st day was very annoying seeing that we only go into Paris and the hotel at a little over midnight.\\n\\nBreakfast and bed\\nToilet outside and noisy outside\\n\\nlocation\\nroom was small\\n\\nThe hotel is well situated for getting around Paris and is a quick metro ride to Gare du Nord for the Eurostar. Staff, facilities and room were very good, with a comfy bed and spacious room. Breakfast was delish and had something for everyone. It attracts business, family and solo travellers. Easy walking distance to the Pompidou centre and Marais shopping and dining area.\\nPlace de la Republique is a busy area and can attract some protests but it wasn\\u2019t disruptive staying at the hotel.\\n\\nThe staff\\nNothing comes to mind\\n\\nRoom was good, as was location and breakfast\\nWhen leaving the breakfast table to get more food, came back and found the table completely cleared.\\n\\nThe location and price\\nFor reasons of hygiene, I didn't like that the rooms and corridors still have carpeted floors.\\n\\nGenerally It is good.Breakfast was excellent. They have a small market online inside for drinks and snacks it was helpfull\\nGenerally Facility got old little bit. Some parts needs refurbishment for ex elevators.\\n\\nHotel staff were very helpful.\\n\\nrooms are big for Paris standart. We will stay again.\\n\\nI liked the lobby, the breakfast area, and the location. The staff was really polite and helpful.\\nThe initial room was terrible. It was in the second floor, internal and not sunny at all, and with a door which was supposed to connect with another room. We complained and they changed the room. They gave us one on the third floor with a view in the Plaza. I strongly recommend asking for a room with a view in the Plaza before booking!\\n\\nLovely old heritage hotel. Breathtaking location, good breakfast. Highly recommend\\nNoisy streets , probably due to it's location.\\n\\nGreat check in - fantastic attentive staff and great breakfast each day !\\n\\nvery good breakfast, fantastic staff\\n\\nAmazing staff, great facilities, central location to shops, restaurants, and couple minute walk to the river and lively streets behind the Republique.

Nice restaurant and cafes around this hotel.\\nThe water facilities were bit poor especially the sink.\\n\\nExcellent selection at breakfast. Service staff were prompt and friendly.\\nChoice of teabags in the room. I can't remember what they had but I remember not having tea because they had an odd (and limited) tea bags in the room. No English breakfast or green tea in the rooms. You could get it at breakfast though.\\n\\nThe three of them were very good.\\nThe taxi driver whom the hotel called to take us to the airport cheated us.\\n\\nStaff were amazing esp reception staff, bag handling.\\n\\nIt was friendly, warm and comfortable. The staff particularly Aida and Marc made us feel so welcome. The facilites are fantastic, as is the location. Will definitely stay here again when we next come to Paris.\\n\\nLocation.

I thought it was not as varied as before - I come to the hotel once or twice a year.\\n\\nThe staff were delightful: kind and helpful throughout.\\nThe food was not great.\\n\\nLocation was excellent, staff was really nice and helpful\\ud83e\\udd29\\n\\nLocation was amazing, 5 minutes from the office. Clean and hotel was lovely.\\nBar closed very early, met with colleagues and wanted after dinner drinks but bar was closed so we had to go find somewhere else. Bar was also quite expensive when it was open, so only had 1 drink there.\\n\\nLots of activities in the area. Close to most attractions\\nNothing really\\n\\ncentrally located\\nbreakfast could have been better.no Indian food options\\n\\nVery noisy location\\n\\nThe hotel is just 2mins walk from train station and lots of eatery places nearby.\\nThe hotel is very clean with comfortable beds. I had an excellent stay. Its near the Gare De Nord too.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast. Beautifully renovated. Right next to where we wanted to be. Right next to a Metro\\nA lot of running up and down the passageway one night.\\n\\nThe breakfast is very hearty, the service staff is very serious and enthusiastic, the transportation is very convenient, and the subway station is right outside the hotel door. I sometimes wake up in the morning to the sound of cars outside my window.\\nWindow sound insulation\\n\\ngood selection of breakfast and facilities\\nbasic baskets\\n\\nThe location is excellent, and also the staff! Breakfast is nice, variance of choices of food. We will stay here when come back to Paris in the future.\\nSound insulation is not very good.\\n\\nTerrific breakfast, as expected of Crowne Plaza hotels. I love that Crowne Plaza hotels cook omelettes to your liking and their pancakes are freshly made, not too sweet and nice and fluffy. Their fruit juice selection is freshly squeezed with pulp still evident and not reconstituted cordial. They provided ironing facilities in the room too. \\nOur room was suitable for the Accessibility impaired, and therefore was large and spacious and had high ceilings, which we loved, however that meant the bathroom was less luxurious with no counter space and water splashed everywhere.\\nA common room with coin operated laundromats would always be welcome, as they are impossible to find amongst hotels in Europe. In fact, the Crowne Plaza hotel in Australia in Hunter Valley, Lovedale provides a communal coin operated laundromat.\\n\\nIt was ok\\nThe fact that I check out a day earlier than my original reservation and I was not reimbursed for the day I did use the hotel. That for me was unfair considering that I have been in there previous hotels and booked the next one through booking.com, so I'm a regular user of your platform and that should be taken into account.\\n\\nproximity to metropolitan and quiet at night\\nproximity to republic square which saw congregations of groups of people lost evenings which were quite intimidating (especially for the kids)\\n\\ngood breakfast, clean and comfortable\\nUber cars not allowed outside the hotel, ok with normal taxis. no USB charge point in bedroom\\n\\nBreakfast was excellent. Varied choices, tables cleared quickly, food stocks replenished promptly\\nThere were no drawers for clothes in the room and nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. Water pressure in the shower was weak.\\n\\ngood location, very polite staff\\n\\nHelpful staff\\nNot applicable\\n\\nfriendly staff and good location The breakfast was good and the location was close to many amenities.\\nthere was no swimming pool\\n\\nBreakfast really good. Working area great\\nNothing to complain about\\n\\nThe hotel is in an ideal location plenty of restaurants, cafes etc in the Republicque area. All the staff we spoke to in the hotel were so lovely. Hotel clean..honestly i couldn't fault the room we stayed in or the restaurant Great breakfast choice. If you dont mind a good walk to the louvres , eifel tower etc it takes about 40 + minutes and it's enjoyable to see the surroundings. If im honest i would advise to get taxi back to the hotel if you spend day sightseeing near tower, cruise etc as you will enjoy your evening meal locally.\\nNothing really as the hotel was lovely. If you don't mind being a little bit outside where the eifel tower is etc the hotel is perfect as we enjoyed the 40 minute walk to the louvre.\\n\\nGreat staff. Offered me a free upgrade for the room with complementary drink as a honeymoon gift. They were helpful with luggage & restaurants reservations.\\nRoom's furniture was a bit old (but very clean and neat)\\n\\nEverything was perfect!!! The hotel was next to a Metro station that served many different train lines. The location was close to everything ( Marais next to us ) and at any time felt quite safe. We recommend it to famillies.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe breakfast is exceptional\\nFacilitiesThe hotel is advertised as 4star hotel, but its far from it , it's 3 stars at most\\n\\nAt first we got a room on 4th floor with 2 small windows under the ceiling. After complaining we got nice room with big window as it is on the pictures. Helpful and nice stuff, comfortable beds, great breakfast with variety of foods.\\nThere should be more hangers for towels in the bathroom. Sometimes at the breakfast some foods were not fresh - corn, friuts and fruit salads.\\n\\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole stay.\\n\\nLocation,clean\\nRoom is very small\\n\\nThe buffet breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of foods to suit all tastes. The hotel was very central with a metro station entrance just beside it. The staff were really pleasant and very helpful.\\n\\nSituated in a very noisey location, could not sleep at all with sirens passing by every few minutes.\\n\\neverything\\nThe attitude of the some of the staff. The cleaner and the person at the reception\\n\\nBreakfast was amazing!! Enjoyed our suite with our family! Loved the metro being right outside of the hotel. Staff were super nice and helpful with whatever we asked of them.\\nIt was really warm and we couldn\\u2019t seem to turn down the thermostat.\\n\\ngood location , helpful stuff comfortable rooms\\n\\nLocation on metro lines\\nMore cleaning in the room is necesary. Especially the bathroom, carpet and window. Check in was not friendly.\\n\\ngreat location, easy access via metro and walking.\\nfriendly staff and really big rooms.\\n\\nthe location was superb as the subway connects to many parts of Paris. the place is lovely with pleasant and helpful staff. the breakfast buffet was fantastic with lots to choose from.\\nnothing in particular\\n\\nClean, nice staff, excellent location, very good breakfast.\\nShower\\u2019s water pressure was OK but could be stronger.\\n\\nThe location, the room\\nthe crowded breakfast\\n\\nvery pleasant staff, fabulous location, easy to access the tourist sites by metro, great buffet breakfast (not included in our rate but no problem to access as required), free wifi, huge family room, very comfortable beds, plenty of interesting restaurants nearby\\u2026\\nsmall amount of cosmetic work required in the shower (loose tile)\\n\\nexcellent location, helpful and friendly staff, great breakfast\\n\\nlocation, spacious rooms, friendly staff, good breakfast\\n\\nperfect location, great breakfast\\n\\nFriendly staff, excellent location. Clean.\\nRoom for 4 is actually too small for 4. Next time I would not buy breakfast and instead have it at any of the bars or bakeries around the corner. Breakfast is not worth the money.\\n\\ngreat location, accessible to all locations from Repablique Metro station (Ave de Republique exit) just a few metres away from the hotel. very friendly staff. Lots of great restaurants around the area. The food in the hotel restaurant is also excellent.\\nthe rooms are small. but that's expected of Paris.\\n\\nAs far as Paris goes, location was good. Right next to a metro station\\nThe hotel is situated in a busy area. There was a lot of traffic noise, sirens, horns etc both late at night and early morning.\\n\\nFound the staff in all areas very helpful and friendly. There was a good brisk, efficient working atmosphere. Bight and clean environment. Breakfast had good variety.\\nI was concerned to see a young boy using the rather sharp knife for the parma ham! \\n\\nI'm afraid my biggest gripe is that on looking at my invoice en route to the airport I was shocked to see I had been charged for ordering taxis. First off we only ordered a taxi for two outings and when presented ourselves on time for them only to be told none available and had to go out on the street to hail one down! I also tipped the concierge - I'm angry to have been charged \\u20ac23.04 for asking for taxi - we should have been informed before hand there was a charge. It left a v sour taste after a nice break in an otherwise well run hotel - just smacked of gouging!\\n\\nThe location was perfect, view outside of window was amazing!\\nThe scents of the body lotion, shampoo, wash etc didn\\u2019t smell that nice.\\n\\nA good location, fair price, good restaurant\\nNo access to Wifi in our part of the building. Requested helped and was told someone was looking into it. The issue was never resolved.\\n\\nThe building was beautiful and the location was fantastic.\\nNothing in particular\\n\\nlocation - plenty of choice for eating around the lively square and metro station very close. \\nroom - very spacious suite. best ever sofa bed! \\nbreakfast - fabulous selection. \\nstaff - very friendly and helpful\\nonly complaint was thought the exec lounge needs relocating.

It is very large and could have easily been divided for hotel guest usage and rental usage, but we were not able to use it at all those nights.\\n\\ngood location. big room and we had wet room bathroom which was huge. great breakfast and helpful staff. temple area is worth exploring\\nnothing really\\n\\nlovely bar and great breakfast. staff were excellent.\\n\\nlocation excellent,\\nroom had no cupboards and insufficient hanging space. room very small\\n\\nGreat feel when you first arrive, very stylish and welcoming, staff very friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast\\nlunch options pricey and limited.\\n\\nLocation was great.

Lifts worked well and room was quiet.\\nBreakfast was good but staffing was inadequate. Tables weren\\u2019t cleared, crockery ran out and when someone asked to have a table cleared we heard the member of staff that they only had 4 staff to cater for 450 clients\\n\\nThe location was good\\nIt is very expensive for what you get. Additionally the breakfast was not very impressive for the price. The rooms are old and tiny.\\n\\nlocation\\nsofa beds were not comfortable\\n\\nThis is a standard corporate business hotel with a fantastic location and good value. For Paris standards, the hotel room is relatively larger than most hotel rooms in the city and the rooms are clean, have air conditioning, and have been recently renovated. It's a big hotel with lots of activity (tourists and conventions), so it's hard to experience personalized service.\\n\\nThe location of the hotel is prime and super convenient. The metro is just outside the hotel and Republique is a major metro hub. It's also very close to the desirable arrondisments of the Marais, Canal Martin etc.\\nWe asked for a quiet room, but our request was not accommodated. We got a room that faced the square....althought I will say, the windows are double pane and blocked out most of the noise.\\n\\nThe hotel is very well located\\nThe breakfast could be better and the staff could be friendlier. A shame that you feel like that you are disturbing them. Only Laure-Line and Sami were amazing !\\n\\nwe like that the rooms were very spacious and clean\\nthe area is a little noisy\\n\\nRoom was fine, front desk personal was very helpful & extremely nice!\\n\\nlocation was perfect.\\nthe room while comfortable was a bit run down and not enough closet space.\\n\\nlocation and generous room size\\nroom a little run-down, roof terras very nice but could be greener\\n\\nThe staff was wonderful.

The kids loved it so much!\\n\\nThe staff didn't know I was a rewards member. They didn't offer any of the membership benefits when I was checking in until I told them I was a Diamond member.\\n\\ncentra\\nnothing\\n\\nThe hotel is well located.\\nMy room was noisy and the customer service level extremely poor. Basic requests were set with an immediate no ( like an additional 30 mins for check out) also room amenities are extremely basic ( broken hair dryer and useless iron)\\n\\nHotel was situated in a great location! Republique Square is a very central point, where all subway lines meet and you can mainly get transferred anywhere in the city. Lounge area downstairs was really well designed, with an amazing bar and lots of tables to accommodate plenty of visitors and guests. Breakfast was also very good!\\nAlso after an online request to give us a room with a view, they tried their best and gave us a room with partial view of the Eiffel Tower. I thank them for that!\\nRooms are not too big and even though updated, they are not brand new. They changed few things within the room, to give it a more fresh vibe (like linens and some design pillows), but some pieces scream outdated. Carpet on the floor is a Huge No from me as well as the entry piece where the coffee machine and closet are placed. This built in furniture it's like it's forgotten from the 80's. Even though we paid for a deluxe double room, the room didn't seem like one. Overall the hotel lounge and lobby are completely renovated, but the rooms are not.\\n\\nBreakfast was fantastic. Location was excellent, we love this area and always stay in the area when in paris.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nBreakfast was perfect plenty of choice\\n\\nBreakfast was great. Location is very nice. Metro access is very close and there are lots of restaurants nearby.\\nThe fridge and the aircon in the room were not working. Some areas of the room and in the passages need maintenance.\\n\\nlocation, room, breakfast, staff\\n\\nClean, Suite was spacious, beds comfortable, location convenient. We were very comfortable so decided to stay longer.\\nWhen wanting to extend our stay reception directed us to go online and book it rather than process it for us. Club lounge not enough seats or food options.\\n\\nThe breakfast was complete, location was excellent.\\nWhen we asked for a plate and spoon in our room we were told it would be an additional charge.\\n\\nAlso we had to change our room as it was too hot.\\n\\nlocation was excellent\\nseemed to cater to large groups,\\n\\nPerfect location. Close to Metro station, 1 minute. The restaurant for breakfast is open until 11 a.m. in the weekend.\\nNo mini bar, old bathroom, small room for family - 2 adults and 2 kids.\\n\\nlocation was fantastic- metro just outside the door! Lots of family friendly restaurants around the square We loved the ping pong table on the terrace\\nbathroom\\u2019s a little dated, cracked tiles etc, breakfast wasn\\u2019t included in room price\\n\\ntop location. 3 stops with the metro to the city centre.\\n\\nLovely stay and a very friendly staff.\\n\\nShower could be better\\n\\nGood, relatively for Paris, comfortable big rooms.\\nBathroom is also very comfortable with a big bath. Very good and tasty breakfast with a big veriery of dishes. \\nLocation very near a main metro station. \\nStaff is very helpful and friendly\\nLocation on the republique square can be problematic sometimes. There are many demonstartions and police presence which cause discomfort when going out\\n\\nFabulous breakfast, wide range of choices including freshly cooked omelettes! Luggage storage was useful. Staff were all really helpful and welcoming giving recommendations for dinner etc.\\nOne of the reasons for booking this hotel was the fitness room but it was very small and could only really accommodate a couple of users at once. There was an outdoor table tennis table but no bats. More teabags/milk as standard in the room (only 2 provided) would be a nice touch.\\n\\nSpacious rooms, friendly staff\\nExec lounge a bit basic, hotel toilets a bit of a mess, couldn\\u2019t change language on TV\\n\\nThe breakfast was delicious and a special thank you to the chef who made the omelettes.\\nMy room was quite far from the lift.\\n\\nNice hotel, good bed, nice general areas\\nshower simple, you should expect a rain shower \\nroom was at the square side; direct above a podium for a manifestation with a lot (really) a lot of noice.. music, loud speakers.. hotel should have advise me upfront or give the choice for another location in the hotel\\n\\nStaff were nice and helpful.\\nIt can be noisy but that's the location.\\n\\nGreat location in the hart of the city next to metro, Excellent restaurants in walking distance. The rooms are not spoiling you with style & comfort, but there is good bed, fast WiFi, Great housekeeping, everything in the room and in the building is very clean, Good bar & kitchen, providing large choice in breakfast.\\nNo IHG award points & nights if you book through booking.com\\n\\nnice location and staff to book trips\\nno vending machines \\nMonoprix grocery store few blocks away\\n\\nGood location, friendly staff and very comfortable\\nSeparate toilet without a sink, no mirror except in the bathroom\\n\\nA lot of extra services and very comprehensive staff!\\n\\nGood location on R\\u00e9publique Square, just to metro station\\nThe service is not at a high level. The restaurant for a breakfast opened from 7 o'clock, which is strange for a business trip. There are better 4 star hotels in Paris\\n\\nLocation was great a few steps from the metro. 3 stops and 5 minutes from Gare du Nord. The entrance is through the archway. Bed room was largest I have had in Paris. Quality great. Free water every day. A few metro stops to Ile de Paris and quite easy to Eiffel Tour too and Sacre Coeur. Nice modern bar with food and views of square. Supermarkets to left and left and bar with breakfast to right and right for 7 Euros. Good choice of restaurants on the square. Interesting to see all the different protests\\nBreakfast was 15 euro prebooked or 25 on the day.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast included in the room rate, although I did not like the coffee at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\\nThe room was very small. There was very little space for our luggage.\\n\\nFriendly staff. Centrally located.\\nNo on-site parking\\n\\nlocation, having a gym and size of the rooms are great. and the breakfast is good too. the bar lost a bit of its appeal...its too bright now. lights could be dimmed down to make it cosier for a night drink.\\nthe hotel has become a bit expensive and forcing you to be charged in advance when could just have the first night guaranteed could be a better option for guests.\\n\\ngood location, nice staff\\ncould use some renovation, windows/balcony dirty\\n\\nParking is not easy...., breakfast, location and room great. Shower only point.\\nShower\\n\\nEven on a busy morning breakfast ran very smoothly.\\nIt might have been the Covid restrictions still in place, but the bar closed early at night.\\n\\nThe cleaning staff was nice\\nI recently had a disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza, where I spent two weeks. Unfortunately, the internet connection in my room was consistently poor, forcing me to relocate to the lobby cafe to work.\\n\\nHowever, my experience at the cafe was equally frustrating. The staff frequently interrupted me during Zoom meetings, insisting that I make a purchase. As a business traveler relying on a stable and quiet workspace, I found this to be unacceptable.\\n\\nGiven the subpar internet and unwelcoming cafe atmosphere, I'm unlikely to return to this hotel. For the price point, I expect a more professional and accommodating environment. There are certainly better options available.\\n\\nRoom was excellent, location was fantastic and the breakfast was amazing\\nNothing\\n\\nSleep\\nAsked for courtyard room, confirmed at checkin, given a streetside room. No coffee maker in room, instant only.\\n\\njust breakfast\\nEVERYTHING \\nthe staff has no knowledge about whereabouts \\nwrong directions.\\ndidn't have any heat all over the stay.\\nthe room rugs were worn out \\nworn out decor and wall papers .\\nCamille the Assistant reception manger was just teying ro be nice so that we dont complain but did nothing about the Heat \\nthe night auditors were very rude and arrogant.\\nthe lady at the reception on our check out day had no sense of direction and gave us wrong itinerary.\\nAll together BAD EXPERIENCE\\n\\nThey were incredibly accommodating with our pets!\\nN/A we liked everything\\n\\nperfect location as there are shops, cafes and places to eat right outside the hotel. Also there is a metro station right outside\\ni think it is a bit overpriced\\n\\nThe Location and the the breakfast\\nCheck in and the checkout policy\\n\\nHotel is in a great location for both walking and taking the Metro. \\nThe daily breakfast was a perfect way to start the morning.\\nEveryone was so nice and accommodating.\\nHighly recommend.\\nWe liked everything.\\n\\nGreat location, warm, modern with old world charm. Breakfast was good, the restaurant staff at breakfast were very attentive.\\nComfortable beds, warm rooms.\\n\\nThe breakfast was absolutely lovely.\\nEverything was fresh and very delicious. \\nThe Staff at the restaurant were very friendly and attentive. We had a wonderful breakfast experience every day of our 7 day stay. We would like to mention how kind and sweet Joice was to my husband and I always greeting us with a smile.\\nThe location of the Hotel was perfect.\\nThe hotel rooms are small and would have been more comfortable if larger and dresser to unpack our clothes away.\\n\\nEverything- great location, service and experience!\\nN/A\\n\\nVery nice hotel and staff.\\nGrumpy bar tender\\n\\nclean\\nservices , drinks and food too expensive\\n\\nBreakfast was good. Location:noisy\\n\\nlocation. Friendly staff\\ncleanliness of the toilet. The sink in the shower is clogged and hair gathers on the floor. \\ni was misled by the publicity photo of a hotel housed in a grand building, but it lacks a proper entrance and the inside decor is like a YMCA property. The gym is too small.\\n\\nLocation, safety, quiet\\nAir conditioner wasn\\u2019t working, the room smelled of cigarettes, the bathroom drain was clogged, there were no amenities.\\n\\nWell located a short walk from the train station\\nRoom was not even close to those shown on the booking page. We got a disabled room for a romantic break that was tiny with the bathroom taking up the majority of the room. Bed was uncomfortable, outside was very noisy at night with one evening someone having the horn on none stop for 5 minutes at 4:20am. \\nBreakfast was the best point of the stay as we decided to spend the vast majority of our time away from the room. One meal in the hotel we had was very poor, hummus made with sesame oil was barely edible and the poke bowl was only just better. \\nRoom was dated and no coffee machine in a 4* hotel I was not sure still existed. \\n\\nOverpriced and certainly not 4* by some measure. Wont be back.\\n\\nThe location was fantastic. It\\u2019s within 50 m of the R\\u00e9publique Metro station and that has a number of metro lines to help you get to anywhere quickly. Breakfast was exceptional with something for everyone. Our rooms were very comfortable with excellent facilities. All staff were extremely friendly. Positioned on a rectangle with Place de la R\\u00e9publique in the centre, there were numerous bars and restaurants to sit and watch the world go by. We loved it!\\nIf I had to be picky, the only thing we didn\\u2019t like was the cost of the rooms and the cost of drinks and food at the hotel. However, this is an excellent hotel, in an excellent location, in Paris - so I wasn\\u2019t surprised at the expense.\\n\\nLocation\\nNothing\\n\\nBreakfast choices were fantastic - for all of the family. The location was great, right beside a metro station. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel was really clean. Staff were very friendly.\\nNothing.\\n\\nLarge hotel with reasonable amenities and good location\\nThe room was full of mosquitoes - I had to ask for it to be sprayed whilst we were out which improved it but only for one night- our whole family has mosquito bites from sleeping in the room - not what I expected for a 4 star expensive hotel- also the breakfast was advertised as being available at 6:30 but didn\\u2019t open til 7 which meant we couldn\\u2019t access it on our day of departure due to the early start to our day of travel despite having paid for it. Overall was ok but not what you should expect for a 4 star hotel in Paris.\\n\\nNot much to like.\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall). When I requested to change the room, they changed the room on the mezzanine floor, with windows to the sky. It is very bad filling when you arrive to the hotel and feel they lied from the first moment.\\nThere where mosquito in the room and we had to fight with them.\\nAt the and the most awful was that my 13 year old daughter\\u2019s shorts where lost/stolen. I talked to the r\\u00e9ception guys several times and no reaction. We knew that it was stolen on the 99% and they didn\\u2019t cared. On the last manager called and said that they were investigating and if it will not be found they will refund. But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nNot much to like\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall).

But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nLoved the location close to lots of cafes and restaurants, on the metro and close to Gare de Nord. The family room was a great size, lots of space for 2 adults and 3 teenagers, and aircon worked well. There was a large courtyard terrace with outdoor games for the teens.\\nLovely hotel, no complaints\\n\\nLocation and room.\\nGreat bedroom with good crisp linen and comfortable mattress as well as a variety of pillows.\\nNothing to flag\\n\\nIt is in an amazing section of Paris with many restaurants. The R\\u00e9publique Metro station is right outside the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was such a time saver and had so many choices to get your day started. Also, the staff was so welcoming and friendly.\\nBecause of the Square right next to the hotel, don't expect it to be super quiet. Maybe some of the interior rooms would be more quiet. WIFI was also spotty in our room.\\n\\nPerfection\\nReally hard bed\\n\\nI had originally reserved one room with two large beds for my 2 daughters, one grandson and me. It worked out even better to have adjoining rooms, one with crib for the baby, one without. Location and comfort were very good. The receptionist who checked me out was kind, calm and professional, a warm send-off.\\nBased on my own experience, working in a 5-star hotel in Boston, I did not appreciate my initial check-in experience, before I realized a manager had modified my original reservation to the adjoining rooms. The receptionist made me feel like I had reserved 2 rooms, as if I'd made a mistake, 'that would be worked out later'. On my check-out morning, I also did not appreciate being made to feel like a criminal for bringing my 14-month-old grandson to the breakfast room before my daughter needed to leave to catch an early train. In general, I think a hotel of this caliber should not nickel & dime customers.\\n\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\n\\nGood location, close to different museums and historical places. Room spacious, clean and quiet. Good choices of food during breakfast.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Air Conditioning in the room did not work for the duration of our stay. After repeated complaints and requests a table fan was sent. This is not acceptable especially when paying for an Air conditioned room. Also, the exhaust in the bathroom did not work.\\n\\nNear metro\\nHow unsafe I felt we turned in daily by 7pm homeless people and daily protesting and rally\\u2019s were the norm across the street which lead to uncertainty with my safety and my children\\n\\nNot much\\nNoisy, basic, bad location, disturbed numerous times by wake up alarm that wasn\\u2019t requested at 3am and housekeeping trying to get us out way before check out\\n\\nI think that that\\u2019s the best my experience\\nNothing\\n\\nThe staff were kind and the breakfast was good.\\nThe distance from the elevator to the room was too long, Wi-Fi was weak.

Absolutely friendly and helpful front desk staff!\\n\\nPerfect location, very convenient for the use of metro. Great breakfast and clean&big rooms.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe location was perfect, metro right outside with lots of restaurants around. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Room was big, plenty of space for family of 4. We had a juliet balcony which was lovely. Breakfast was amazing, so fresh and delicious.\\nNothing, it was all great. \\nAlthough it's probably reasonable to note that Place de Republique is popular for protests and homelessness. We saw one protest and also on 2 evenings there was a food bank in the square. We didn't encounter any issues at all, and would go back to the same hotel again in the future.\\n\\nNice room great staff from cheakin to bar staff great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nWow! I was looking for somewhere nice for myself, husband and sons, somewhere near to Paris, a decent sized room. The room was large, clean and comfy. The staff were lovely!! Bonus fact, they uses this hotel in the TV series Modern Family when they came to Paris! The hotel has direct metro access to the front door, 20-30 mins into Paris. Get the navigo cards to travel, cheap and efficient. Each card can have 10 trips on and you can \\\"recharge\\\" them for more. They're a bit like oyster cards and can be got at the stations.

In the room that had windows overlooking the interior patio, it was worse. When we wanted to turn on the air conditioning, we noticed that it was not cold at all. On the contrary, the air blown is hot. We try to fall asleep, without success. We end up calling reception. After making excuses that would have made you fall asleep standing up to explain the non-functioning such as \\\"these are mandatory environmental measures\\\" they lent us a fan with a built-in thermometer. The temperature indicated 26\\u00b0. The next day, we went to ask for an explanation. We were finally told that the instructions given by management were not to operate the air conditioning. Probably to save electricity. But this is unacceptable for an establishment that claims 4 stars. It is false information to present itself as an air-conditioned hotel. We spent 2 very bad nights sleeping badly. \\nAdded to this a very slow reception staff, a kind of latent \\\"I don't care\\\" attitude, a coffee machine that doesn't even work etc... \\nWe will never set foot in this hotel again.

The majority of reviews are concentrated between 8,000 and 12,000 words, with a notable peak around 10,000 words, indicating that most hotels have a substantial volume of written feedback. This suggests that guests tend to leave detailed reviews, which could reflect high engagement or the importance of sustainability as a topic of discussion. There are fewer reviews with lengths below 6,000 or above 14,000 words, indicating that extremely short or long reviews are less common.\n",

And we were even upgraded to a suite.\\nSuper comfortable room, a real apartment, very pleasant bedding.\\nThe Crown Plaza is very well located for visiting Paris.\\nThe staff is great, the facilities and relaxation areas are great. And the prize goes to the breakfast (included in the price) in a super cocooning restaurant room, there is something for everyone, everything is delicious and fresh. We loved everything. Thank you\\nThe incivility of the other tourists in the hotel, who leave their rubbish in the corridor as if we were in a pigsty and the hotel staff were their maids or slaves. Where is the world going?\\n\\nthe common areas, breakfast\\nThe reception staff very unpleasant, unfortunately all the teams (morning and evening)... very very limited sense of welcome\\n\\nthe location\\nthe water flow in the shower, we had a trickle of water and barely warm\\n\\nThe central position and the family rooms\\nthe equipment that deserves a renovation\\n\\nsituation\\nroom almost not heated as well as the bathroom!!! we can reduce the heating in the hotel but there it was downright cold. on the other hand the reception and the bar well heated \\u2026\\u2026???????\\n\\nGreat location and friendly staff\\nNo\\n\\nVery close to the center, nice view, nice Buffett\\nNeeds some redecoration / maintenance\\nThey ask for security deposit during check in without prior information\\n\\nThe breakfast was excellent. Even kids loved it. Staff were wonderful. Easy access to all locations via metro. Close to the Cirque d'Hiver which we loved.\\nThe heating in the room didn't work so the room was quite cold. When I called for assistance they sent us a heater which didn't work, so they had to send another one. Also, check in took a long time and kids were becoming impatient. Apparently there was a miscommunication between Booking.com and the hotel.\\n\\nGood room size for Paris. Nice lobby and bar area.\\nBreakfast is pretty bad - quality of food needs to improve. Add some mushrooms or vegetables to the hot buffet selection.\\n\\nGym / Fitness room is a joke with 3 machines. 2 people would struggle to do anything in there at the same time. Maybe get a deal for day passes with gym next door. Literally nextdoor!\\n\\nHigh quality\\nWe had a quad room, very tight on space. However beds super comfortable\\n\\nThe breakfast was exceptional, with many varieties. \\nThe room was clean, the bathroom was spacious and modern.\\nThe location is superb, very close to the Metro.\\n\\nThe location\\nThe lady on reception said she was going to upgrade us, it was still a standard room\\n\\nBreakfast\\nYour lift.

But, hey, Paris is expensive.\\n\\nIt is in a very central busy plaza with the metro right outside. The hotel has modern decor and is well serviced. The breakfast had an amazing array of foods it was lovely on the first day, but on the second, we came down later, and a lot of the options had not been replenished. \\nThe room was large with two double beds for the four of us.\\nThere was no view from the window as it faced a wall so quiet a dark room.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and very accommodating. Cleaning staff did a good job with the room everyday. Metro station entrance and exist is right outside of the hotel.\\nWhile the windows deafened most of the noise from the plaza directly outside, we still could hear people yelling in the plaza very early in the morning. Wouldn't call it a deal breaker though.\\n\\nStaff and location\\nLimited space in the room.\\nMediocre breakfast for Paris.\\n\\nFriendly and Accommodating Staff. Great Cleaning Service! The breakfast was delicious. Perfect location right next to the Metro for tourists. We even got a room upgrade!\\n\\nGreat location, good sized room for Paris\\nExpensive, like most accommodation in central Paris\\n\\nLocation, room size and service.\\nToo few electrical plugs, particularly no plug in the bathroom. The property was a bit too expansive- for about a total of $400 a night without being in the very center of Paris one should get a junior sweet. There were too few English language TV channels. The internet was completely open.\\n\\nLocated in a central area. Easy to walk to many places. Clean and lovely court yard\\nStaff were super pleasant and very helpful\\nI didn\\u2019t know that I would be charged city taxes. Would have been helpful to have that information\\n\\nRight on the square\\u2014lots of activity and choices to eat\\nCan\\u2019t think of anything\\n\\nGreat location great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nbreakfast was amazing and staff were very helpful. Loved the view of the courtyard seeing the pop-up looking resturants and live size chess board. \\nWe loved that they had great restaurant recommendations and connections to get quick assess into the different restaurants\\nour first 2 nights the cleaning staff kept waking is up to clean the rooms, which on the 1st day was very annoying seeing that we only go into Paris and the hotel at a little over midnight.\\n\\nBreakfast and bed\\nToilet outside and noisy outside\\n\\nlocation\\nroom was small\\n\\nThe hotel is well situated for getting around Paris and is a quick metro ride to Gare du Nord for the Eurostar. Staff, facilities and room were very good, with a comfy bed and spacious room. Breakfast was delish and had something for everyone. It attracts business, family and solo travellers. Easy walking distance to the Pompidou centre and Marais shopping and dining area.\\nPlace de la Republique is a busy area and can attract some protests but it wasn\\u2019t disruptive staying at the hotel.\\n\\nThe staff\\nNothing comes to mind\\n\\nRoom was good, as was location and breakfast\\nWhen leaving the breakfast table to get more food, came back and found the table completely cleared.\\n\\nThe location and price\\nFor reasons of hygiene, I didn't like that the rooms and corridors still have carpeted floors.\\n\\nGenerally It is good.Breakfast was excellent. They have a small market online inside for drinks and snacks it was helpfull\\nGenerally Facility got old little bit. Some parts needs refurbishment for ex elevators.\\n\\nHotel staff were very helpful.\\n\\nrooms are big for Paris standart. We will stay again.\\n\\nI liked the lobby, the breakfast area, and the location. The staff was really polite and helpful.\\nThe initial room was terrible. It was in the second floor, internal and not sunny at all, and with a door which was supposed to connect with another room. We complained and they changed the room. They gave us one on the third floor with a view in the Plaza. I strongly recommend asking for a room with a view in the Plaza before booking!\\n\\nLovely old heritage hotel. Breathtaking location, good breakfast. Highly recommend\\nNoisy streets , probably due to it's location.\\n\\nGreat check in - fantastic attentive staff and great breakfast each day !\\n\\nvery good breakfast, fantastic staff\\n\\nAmazing staff, great facilities, central location to shops, restaurants, and couple minute walk to the river and lively streets behind the Republique.

Nice restaurant and cafes around this hotel.\\nThe water facilities were bit poor especially the sink.\\n\\nExcellent selection at breakfast. Service staff were prompt and friendly.\\nChoice of teabags in the room. I can't remember what they had but I remember not having tea because they had an odd (and limited) tea bags in the room. No English breakfast or green tea in the rooms. You could get it at breakfast though.\\n\\nThe three of them were very good.\\nThe taxi driver whom the hotel called to take us to the airport cheated us.\\n\\nStaff were amazing esp reception staff, bag handling.\\n\\nIt was friendly, warm and comfortable. The staff particularly Aida and Marc made us feel so welcome. The facilites are fantastic, as is the location. Will definitely stay here again when we next come to Paris.\\n\\nLocation.

I thought it was not as varied as before - I come to the hotel once or twice a year.\\n\\nThe staff were delightful: kind and helpful throughout.\\nThe food was not great.\\n\\nLocation was excellent, staff was really nice and helpful\\ud83e\\udd29\\n\\nLocation was amazing, 5 minutes from the office. Clean and hotel was lovely.\\nBar closed very early, met with colleagues and wanted after dinner drinks but bar was closed so we had to go find somewhere else. Bar was also quite expensive when it was open, so only had 1 drink there.\\n\\nLots of activities in the area. Close to most attractions\\nNothing really\\n\\ncentrally located\\nbreakfast could have been better.no Indian food options\\n\\nVery noisy location\\n\\nThe hotel is just 2mins walk from train station and lots of eatery places nearby.\\nThe hotel is very clean with comfortable beds. I had an excellent stay. Its near the Gare De Nord too.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast. Beautifully renovated. Right next to where we wanted to be. Right next to a Metro\\nA lot of running up and down the passageway one night.\\n\\nThe breakfast is very hearty, the service staff is very serious and enthusiastic, the transportation is very convenient, and the subway station is right outside the hotel door. I sometimes wake up in the morning to the sound of cars outside my window.\\nWindow sound insulation\\n\\ngood selection of breakfast and facilities\\nbasic baskets\\n\\nThe location is excellent, and also the staff! Breakfast is nice, variance of choices of food. We will stay here when come back to Paris in the future.\\nSound insulation is not very good.\\n\\nTerrific breakfast, as expected of Crowne Plaza hotels. I love that Crowne Plaza hotels cook omelettes to your liking and their pancakes are freshly made, not too sweet and nice and fluffy. Their fruit juice selection is freshly squeezed with pulp still evident and not reconstituted cordial. They provided ironing facilities in the room too. \\nOur room was suitable for the Accessibility impaired, and therefore was large and spacious and had high ceilings, which we loved, however that meant the bathroom was less luxurious with no counter space and water splashed everywhere.\\nA common room with coin operated laundromats would always be welcome, as they are impossible to find amongst hotels in Europe. In fact, the Crowne Plaza hotel in Australia in Hunter Valley, Lovedale provides a communal coin operated laundromat.\\n\\nIt was ok\\nThe fact that I check out a day earlier than my original reservation and I was not reimbursed for the day I did use the hotel. That for me was unfair considering that I have been in there previous hotels and booked the next one through booking.com, so I'm a regular user of your platform and that should be taken into account.\\n\\nproximity to metropolitan and quiet at night\\nproximity to republic square which saw congregations of groups of people lost evenings which were quite intimidating (especially for the kids)\\n\\ngood breakfast, clean and comfortable\\nUber cars not allowed outside the hotel, ok with normal taxis. no USB charge point in bedroom\\n\\nBreakfast was excellent. Varied choices, tables cleared quickly, food stocks replenished promptly\\nThere were no drawers for clothes in the room and nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. Water pressure in the shower was weak.\\n\\ngood location, very polite staff\\n\\nHelpful staff\\nNot applicable\\n\\nfriendly staff and good location The breakfast was good and the location was close to many amenities.\\nthere was no swimming pool\\n\\nBreakfast really good. Working area great\\nNothing to complain about\\n\\nThe hotel is in an ideal location plenty of restaurants, cafes etc in the Republicque area. All the staff we spoke to in the hotel were so lovely. Hotel clean..honestly i couldn't fault the room we stayed in or the restaurant Great breakfast choice. If you dont mind a good walk to the louvres , eifel tower etc it takes about 40 + minutes and it's enjoyable to see the surroundings. If im honest i would advise to get taxi back to the hotel if you spend day sightseeing near tower, cruise etc as you will enjoy your evening meal locally.\\nNothing really as the hotel was lovely. If you don't mind being a little bit outside where the eifel tower is etc the hotel is perfect as we enjoyed the 40 minute walk to the louvre.\\n\\nGreat staff. Offered me a free upgrade for the room with complementary drink as a honeymoon gift. They were helpful with luggage & restaurants reservations.\\nRoom's furniture was a bit old (but very clean and neat)\\n\\nEverything was perfect!!! The hotel was next to a Metro station that served many different train lines. The location was close to everything ( Marais next to us ) and at any time felt quite safe. We recommend it to famillies.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe breakfast is exceptional\\nFacilitiesThe hotel is advertised as 4star hotel, but its far from it , it's 3 stars at most\\n\\nAt first we got a room on 4th floor with 2 small windows under the ceiling. After complaining we got nice room with big window as it is on the pictures. Helpful and nice stuff, comfortable beds, great breakfast with variety of foods.\\nThere should be more hangers for towels in the bathroom. Sometimes at the breakfast some foods were not fresh - corn, friuts and fruit salads.\\n\\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole stay.\\n\\nLocation,clean\\nRoom is very small\\n\\nThe buffet breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of foods to suit all tastes. The hotel was very central with a metro station entrance just beside it. The staff were really pleasant and very helpful.\\n\\nSituated in a very noisey location, could not sleep at all with sirens passing by every few minutes.\\n\\neverything\\nThe attitude of the some of the staff. The cleaner and the person at the reception\\n\\nBreakfast was amazing!! Enjoyed our suite with our family! Loved the metro being right outside of the hotel. Staff were super nice and helpful with whatever we asked of them.\\nIt was really warm and we couldn\\u2019t seem to turn down the thermostat.\\n\\ngood location , helpful stuff comfortable rooms\\n\\nLocation on metro lines\\nMore cleaning in the room is necesary. Especially the bathroom, carpet and window. Check in was not friendly.\\n\\ngreat location, easy access via metro and walking.\\nfriendly staff and really big rooms.\\n\\nthe location was superb as the subway connects to many parts of Paris. the place is lovely with pleasant and helpful staff. the breakfast buffet was fantastic with lots to choose from.\\nnothing in particular\\n\\nClean, nice staff, excellent location, very good breakfast.\\nShower\\u2019s water pressure was OK but could be stronger.\\n\\nThe location, the room\\nthe crowded breakfast\\n\\nvery pleasant staff, fabulous location, easy to access the tourist sites by metro, great buffet breakfast (not included in our rate but no problem to access as required), free wifi, huge family room, very comfortable beds, plenty of interesting restaurants nearby\\u2026\\nsmall amount of cosmetic work required in the shower (loose tile)\\n\\nexcellent location, helpful and friendly staff, great breakfast\\n\\nlocation, spacious rooms, friendly staff, good breakfast\\n\\nperfect location, great breakfast\\n\\nFriendly staff, excellent location. Clean.\\nRoom for 4 is actually too small for 4. Next time I would not buy breakfast and instead have it at any of the bars or bakeries around the corner. Breakfast is not worth the money.\\n\\ngreat location, accessible to all locations from Repablique Metro station (Ave de Republique exit) just a few metres away from the hotel. very friendly staff. Lots of great restaurants around the area. The food in the hotel restaurant is also excellent.\\nthe rooms are small. but that's expected of Paris.\\n\\nAs far as Paris goes, location was good. Right next to a metro station\\nThe hotel is situated in a busy area. There was a lot of traffic noise, sirens, horns etc both late at night and early morning.\\n\\nFound the staff in all areas very helpful and friendly. There was a good brisk, efficient working atmosphere. Bight and clean environment. Breakfast had good variety.\\nI was concerned to see a young boy using the rather sharp knife for the parma ham! \\n\\nI'm afraid my biggest gripe is that on looking at my invoice en route to the airport I was shocked to see I had been charged for ordering taxis. First off we only ordered a taxi for two outings and when presented ourselves on time for them only to be told none available and had to go out on the street to hail one down! I also tipped the concierge - I'm angry to have been charged \\u20ac23.04 for asking for taxi - we should have been informed before hand there was a charge. It left a v sour taste after a nice break in an otherwise well run hotel - just smacked of gouging!\\n\\nThe location was perfect, view outside of window was amazing!\\nThe scents of the body lotion, shampoo, wash etc didn\\u2019t smell that nice.\\n\\nA good location, fair price, good restaurant\\nNo access to Wifi in our part of the building. Requested helped and was told someone was looking into it. The issue was never resolved.\\n\\nThe building was beautiful and the location was fantastic.\\nNothing in particular\\n\\nlocation - plenty of choice for eating around the lively square and metro station very close. \\nroom - very spacious suite. best ever sofa bed! \\nbreakfast - fabulous selection. \\nstaff - very friendly and helpful\\nonly complaint was thought the exec lounge needs relocating.

It is very large and could have easily been divided for hotel guest usage and rental usage, but we were not able to use it at all those nights.\\n\\ngood location. big room and we had wet room bathroom which was huge. great breakfast and helpful staff. temple area is worth exploring\\nnothing really\\n\\nlovely bar and great breakfast. staff were excellent.\\n\\nlocation excellent,\\nroom had no cupboards and insufficient hanging space. room very small\\n\\nGreat feel when you first arrive, very stylish and welcoming, staff very friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast\\nlunch options pricey and limited.\\n\\nLocation was great.

Lifts worked well and room was quiet.\\nBreakfast was good but staffing was inadequate. Tables weren\\u2019t cleared, crockery ran out and when someone asked to have a table cleared we heard the member of staff that they only had 4 staff to cater for 450 clients\\n\\nThe location was good\\nIt is very expensive for what you get. Additionally the breakfast was not very impressive for the price. The rooms are old and tiny.\\n\\nlocation\\nsofa beds were not comfortable\\n\\nThis is a standard corporate business hotel with a fantastic location and good value. For Paris standards, the hotel room is relatively larger than most hotel rooms in the city and the rooms are clean, have air conditioning, and have been recently renovated. It's a big hotel with lots of activity (tourists and conventions), so it's hard to experience personalized service.\\n\\nThe location of the hotel is prime and super convenient. The metro is just outside the hotel and Republique is a major metro hub. It's also very close to the desirable arrondisments of the Marais, Canal Martin etc.\\nWe asked for a quiet room, but our request was not accommodated. We got a room that faced the square....althought I will say, the windows are double pane and blocked out most of the noise.\\n\\nThe hotel is very well located\\nThe breakfast could be better and the staff could be friendlier. A shame that you feel like that you are disturbing them. Only Laure-Line and Sami were amazing !\\n\\nwe like that the rooms were very spacious and clean\\nthe area is a little noisy\\n\\nRoom was fine, front desk personal was very helpful & extremely nice!\\n\\nlocation was perfect.\\nthe room while comfortable was a bit run down and not enough closet space.\\n\\nlocation and generous room size\\nroom a little run-down, roof terras very nice but could be greener\\n\\nThe staff was wonderful.

The kids loved it so much!\\n\\nThe staff didn't know I was a rewards member. They didn't offer any of the membership benefits when I was checking in until I told them I was a Diamond member.\\n\\ncentra\\nnothing\\n\\nThe hotel is well located.\\nMy room was noisy and the customer service level extremely poor. Basic requests were set with an immediate no ( like an additional 30 mins for check out) also room amenities are extremely basic ( broken hair dryer and useless iron)\\n\\nHotel was situated in a great location! Republique Square is a very central point, where all subway lines meet and you can mainly get transferred anywhere in the city. Lounge area downstairs was really well designed, with an amazing bar and lots of tables to accommodate plenty of visitors and guests. Breakfast was also very good!\\nAlso after an online request to give us a room with a view, they tried their best and gave us a room with partial view of the Eiffel Tower. I thank them for that!\\nRooms are not too big and even though updated, they are not brand new. They changed few things within the room, to give it a more fresh vibe (like linens and some design pillows), but some pieces scream outdated. Carpet on the floor is a Huge No from me as well as the entry piece where the coffee machine and closet are placed. This built in furniture it's like it's forgotten from the 80's. Even though we paid for a deluxe double room, the room didn't seem like one. Overall the hotel lounge and lobby are completely renovated, but the rooms are not.\\n\\nBreakfast was fantastic. Location was excellent, we love this area and always stay in the area when in paris.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nBreakfast was perfect plenty of choice\\n\\nBreakfast was great. Location is very nice. Metro access is very close and there are lots of restaurants nearby.\\nThe fridge and the aircon in the room were not working. Some areas of the room and in the passages need maintenance.\\n\\nlocation, room, breakfast, staff\\n\\nClean, Suite was spacious, beds comfortable, location convenient. We were very comfortable so decided to stay longer.\\nWhen wanting to extend our stay reception directed us to go online and book it rather than process it for us. Club lounge not enough seats or food options.\\n\\nThe breakfast was complete, location was excellent.\\nWhen we asked for a plate and spoon in our room we were told it would be an additional charge.\\n\\nAlso we had to change our room as it was too hot.\\n\\nlocation was excellent\\nseemed to cater to large groups,\\n\\nPerfect location. Close to Metro station, 1 minute. The restaurant for breakfast is open until 11 a.m. in the weekend.\\nNo mini bar, old bathroom, small room for family - 2 adults and 2 kids.\\n\\nlocation was fantastic- metro just outside the door! Lots of family friendly restaurants around the square We loved the ping pong table on the terrace\\nbathroom\\u2019s a little dated, cracked tiles etc, breakfast wasn\\u2019t included in room price\\n\\ntop location. 3 stops with the metro to the city centre.\\n\\nLovely stay and a very friendly staff.\\n\\nShower could be better\\n\\nGood, relatively for Paris, comfortable big rooms.\\nBathroom is also very comfortable with a big bath. Very good and tasty breakfast with a big veriery of dishes. \\nLocation very near a main metro station. \\nStaff is very helpful and friendly\\nLocation on the republique square can be problematic sometimes. There are many demonstartions and police presence which cause discomfort when going out\\n\\nFabulous breakfast, wide range of choices including freshly cooked omelettes! Luggage storage was useful. Staff were all really helpful and welcoming giving recommendations for dinner etc.\\nOne of the reasons for booking this hotel was the fitness room but it was very small and could only really accommodate a couple of users at once. There was an outdoor table tennis table but no bats. More teabags/milk as standard in the room (only 2 provided) would be a nice touch.\\n\\nSpacious rooms, friendly staff\\nExec lounge a bit basic, hotel toilets a bit of a mess, couldn\\u2019t change language on TV\\n\\nThe breakfast was delicious and a special thank you to the chef who made the omelettes.\\nMy room was quite far from the lift.\\n\\nNice hotel, good bed, nice general areas\\nshower simple, you should expect a rain shower \\nroom was at the square side; direct above a podium for a manifestation with a lot (really) a lot of noice.. music, loud speakers.. hotel should have advise me upfront or give the choice for another location in the hotel\\n\\nStaff were nice and helpful.\\nIt can be noisy but that's the location.\\n\\nGreat location in the hart of the city next to metro, Excellent restaurants in walking distance. The rooms are not spoiling you with style & comfort, but there is good bed, fast WiFi, Great housekeeping, everything in the room and in the building is very clean, Good bar & kitchen, providing large choice in breakfast.\\nNo IHG award points & nights if you book through booking.com\\n\\nnice location and staff to book trips\\nno vending machines \\nMonoprix grocery store few blocks away\\n\\nGood location, friendly staff and very comfortable\\nSeparate toilet without a sink, no mirror except in the bathroom\\n\\nA lot of extra services and very comprehensive staff!\\n\\nGood location on R\\u00e9publique Square, just to metro station\\nThe service is not at a high level. The restaurant for a breakfast opened from 7 o'clock, which is strange for a business trip. There are better 4 star hotels in Paris\\n\\nLocation was great a few steps from the metro. 3 stops and 5 minutes from Gare du Nord. The entrance is through the archway. Bed room was largest I have had in Paris. Quality great. Free water every day. A few metro stops to Ile de Paris and quite easy to Eiffel Tour too and Sacre Coeur. Nice modern bar with food and views of square. Supermarkets to left and left and bar with breakfast to right and right for 7 Euros. Good choice of restaurants on the square. Interesting to see all the different protests\\nBreakfast was 15 euro prebooked or 25 on the day.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast included in the room rate, although I did not like the coffee at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\\nThe room was very small. There was very little space for our luggage.\\n\\nFriendly staff. Centrally located.\\nNo on-site parking\\n\\nlocation, having a gym and size of the rooms are great. and the breakfast is good too. the bar lost a bit of its appeal...its too bright now. lights could be dimmed down to make it cosier for a night drink.\\nthe hotel has become a bit expensive and forcing you to be charged in advance when could just have the first night guaranteed could be a better option for guests.\\n\\ngood location, nice staff\\ncould use some renovation, windows/balcony dirty\\n\\nParking is not easy...., breakfast, location and room great. Shower only point.\\nShower\\n\\nEven on a busy morning breakfast ran very smoothly.\\nIt might have been the Covid restrictions still in place, but the bar closed early at night.\\n\\nThe cleaning staff was nice\\nI recently had a disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza, where I spent two weeks. Unfortunately, the internet connection in my room was consistently poor, forcing me to relocate to the lobby cafe to work.\\n\\nHowever, my experience at the cafe was equally frustrating. The staff frequently interrupted me during Zoom meetings, insisting that I make a purchase. As a business traveler relying on a stable and quiet workspace, I found this to be unacceptable.\\n\\nGiven the subpar internet and unwelcoming cafe atmosphere, I'm unlikely to return to this hotel. For the price point, I expect a more professional and accommodating environment. There are certainly better options available.\\n\\nRoom was excellent, location was fantastic and the breakfast was amazing\\nNothing\\n\\nSleep\\nAsked for courtyard room, confirmed at checkin, given a streetside room. No coffee maker in room, instant only.\\n\\njust breakfast\\nEVERYTHING \\nthe staff has no knowledge about whereabouts \\nwrong directions.\\ndidn't have any heat all over the stay.\\nthe room rugs were worn out \\nworn out decor and wall papers .\\nCamille the Assistant reception manger was just teying ro be nice so that we dont complain but did nothing about the Heat \\nthe night auditors were very rude and arrogant.\\nthe lady at the reception on our check out day had no sense of direction and gave us wrong itinerary.\\nAll together BAD EXPERIENCE\\n\\nThey were incredibly accommodating with our pets!\\nN/A we liked everything\\n\\nperfect location as there are shops, cafes and places to eat right outside the hotel. Also there is a metro station right outside\\ni think it is a bit overpriced\\n\\nThe Location and the the breakfast\\nCheck in and the checkout policy\\n\\nHotel is in a great location for both walking and taking the Metro. \\nThe daily breakfast was a perfect way to start the morning.\\nEveryone was so nice and accommodating.\\nHighly recommend.\\nWe liked everything.\\n\\nGreat location, warm, modern with old world charm. Breakfast was good, the restaurant staff at breakfast were very attentive.\\nComfortable beds, warm rooms.\\n\\nThe breakfast was absolutely lovely.\\nEverything was fresh and very delicious. \\nThe Staff at the restaurant were very friendly and attentive. We had a wonderful breakfast experience every day of our 7 day stay. We would like to mention how kind and sweet Joice was to my husband and I always greeting us with a smile.\\nThe location of the Hotel was perfect.\\nThe hotel rooms are small and would have been more comfortable if larger and dresser to unpack our clothes away.\\n\\nEverything- great location, service and experience!\\nN/A\\n\\nVery nice hotel and staff.\\nGrumpy bar tender\\n\\nclean\\nservices , drinks and food too expensive\\n\\nBreakfast was good. Location:noisy\\n\\nlocation. Friendly staff\\ncleanliness of the toilet. The sink in the shower is clogged and hair gathers on the floor. \\ni was misled by the publicity photo of a hotel housed in a grand building, but it lacks a proper entrance and the inside decor is like a YMCA property. The gym is too small.\\n\\nLocation, safety, quiet\\nAir conditioner wasn\\u2019t working, the room smelled of cigarettes, the bathroom drain was clogged, there were no amenities.\\n\\nWell located a short walk from the train station\\nRoom was not even close to those shown on the booking page. We got a disabled room for a romantic break that was tiny with the bathroom taking up the majority of the room. Bed was uncomfortable, outside was very noisy at night with one evening someone having the horn on none stop for 5 minutes at 4:20am. \\nBreakfast was the best point of the stay as we decided to spend the vast majority of our time away from the room. One meal in the hotel we had was very poor, hummus made with sesame oil was barely edible and the poke bowl was only just better. \\nRoom was dated and no coffee machine in a 4* hotel I was not sure still existed. \\n\\nOverpriced and certainly not 4* by some measure. Wont be back.\\n\\nThe location was fantastic. It\\u2019s within 50 m of the R\\u00e9publique Metro station and that has a number of metro lines to help you get to anywhere quickly. Breakfast was exceptional with something for everyone. Our rooms were very comfortable with excellent facilities. All staff were extremely friendly. Positioned on a rectangle with Place de la R\\u00e9publique in the centre, there were numerous bars and restaurants to sit and watch the world go by. We loved it!\\nIf I had to be picky, the only thing we didn\\u2019t like was the cost of the rooms and the cost of drinks and food at the hotel. However, this is an excellent hotel, in an excellent location, in Paris - so I wasn\\u2019t surprised at the expense.\\n\\nLocation\\nNothing\\n\\nBreakfast choices were fantastic - for all of the family. The location was great, right beside a metro station. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel was really clean. Staff were very friendly.\\nNothing.\\n\\nLarge hotel with reasonable amenities and good location\\nThe room was full of mosquitoes - I had to ask for it to be sprayed whilst we were out which improved it but only for one night- our whole family has mosquito bites from sleeping in the room - not what I expected for a 4 star expensive hotel- also the breakfast was advertised as being available at 6:30 but didn\\u2019t open til 7 which meant we couldn\\u2019t access it on our day of departure due to the early start to our day of travel despite having paid for it. Overall was ok but not what you should expect for a 4 star hotel in Paris.\\n\\nNot much to like.\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall). When I requested to change the room, they changed the room on the mezzanine floor, with windows to the sky. It is very bad filling when you arrive to the hotel and feel they lied from the first moment.\\nThere where mosquito in the room and we had to fight with them.\\nAt the and the most awful was that my 13 year old daughter\\u2019s shorts where lost/stolen. I talked to the r\\u00e9ception guys several times and no reaction. We knew that it was stolen on the 99% and they didn\\u2019t cared. On the last manager called and said that they were investigating and if it will not be found they will refund. But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nNot much to like\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall).

But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nLoved the location close to lots of cafes and restaurants, on the metro and close to Gare de Nord. The family room was a great size, lots of space for 2 adults and 3 teenagers, and aircon worked well. There was a large courtyard terrace with outdoor games for the teens.\\nLovely hotel, no complaints\\n\\nLocation and room.\\nGreat bedroom with good crisp linen and comfortable mattress as well as a variety of pillows.\\nNothing to flag\\n\\nIt is in an amazing section of Paris with many restaurants. The R\\u00e9publique Metro station is right outside the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was such a time saver and had so many choices to get your day started. Also, the staff was so welcoming and friendly.\\nBecause of the Square right next to the hotel, don't expect it to be super quiet. Maybe some of the interior rooms would be more quiet. WIFI was also spotty in our room.\\n\\nPerfection\\nReally hard bed\\n\\nI had originally reserved one room with two large beds for my 2 daughters, one grandson and me. It worked out even better to have adjoining rooms, one with crib for the baby, one without. Location and comfort were very good. The receptionist who checked me out was kind, calm and professional, a warm send-off.\\nBased on my own experience, working in a 5-star hotel in Boston, I did not appreciate my initial check-in experience, before I realized a manager had modified my original reservation to the adjoining rooms. The receptionist made me feel like I had reserved 2 rooms, as if I'd made a mistake, 'that would be worked out later'. On my check-out morning, I also did not appreciate being made to feel like a criminal for bringing my 14-month-old grandson to the breakfast room before my daughter needed to leave to catch an early train. In general, I think a hotel of this caliber should not nickel & dime customers.\\n\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\n\\nGood location, close to different museums and historical places. Room spacious, clean and quiet. Good choices of food during breakfast.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Air Conditioning in the room did not work for the duration of our stay. After repeated complaints and requests a table fan was sent. This is not acceptable especially when paying for an Air conditioned room. Also, the exhaust in the bathroom did not work.\\n\\nNear metro\\nHow unsafe I felt we turned in daily by 7pm homeless people and daily protesting and rally\\u2019s were the norm across the street which lead to uncertainty with my safety and my children\\n\\nNot much\\nNoisy, basic, bad location, disturbed numerous times by wake up alarm that wasn\\u2019t requested at 3am and housekeeping trying to get us out way before check out\\n\\nI think that that\\u2019s the best my experience\\nNothing\\n\\nThe staff were kind and the breakfast was good.\\nThe distance from the elevator to the room was too long, Wi-Fi was weak.

Absolutely friendly and helpful front desk staff!\\n\\nPerfect location, very convenient for the use of metro. Great breakfast and clean&big rooms.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe location was perfect, metro right outside with lots of restaurants around. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Room was big, plenty of space for family of 4. We had a juliet balcony which was lovely. Breakfast was amazing, so fresh and delicious.\\nNothing, it was all great. \\nAlthough it's probably reasonable to note that Place de Republique is popular for protests and homelessness. We saw one protest and also on 2 evenings there was a food bank in the square. We didn't encounter any issues at all, and would go back to the same hotel again in the future.\\n\\nNice room great staff from cheakin to bar staff great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nWow! I was looking for somewhere nice for myself, husband and sons, somewhere near to Paris, a decent sized room. The room was large, clean and comfy. The staff were lovely!! Bonus fact, they uses this hotel in the TV series Modern Family when they came to Paris! The hotel has direct metro access to the front door, 20-30 mins into Paris. Get the navigo cards to travel, cheap and efficient. Each card can have 10 trips on and you can \\\"recharge\\\" them for more. They're a bit like oyster cards and can be got at the stations.

In the room that had windows overlooking the interior patio, it was worse. When we wanted to turn on the air conditioning, we noticed that it was not cold at all. On the contrary, the air blown is hot. We try to fall asleep, without success. We end up calling reception. After making excuses that would have made you fall asleep standing up to explain the non-functioning such as \\\"these are mandatory environmental measures\\\" they lent us a fan with a built-in thermometer. The temperature indicated 26\\u00b0. The next day, we went to ask for an explanation. We were finally told that the instructions given by management were not to operate the air conditioning. Probably to save electricity. But this is unacceptable for an establishment that claims 4 stars. It is false information to present itself as an air-conditioned hotel. We spent 2 very bad nights sleeping badly. \\nAdded to this a very slow reception staff, a kind of latent \\\"I don't care\\\" attitude, a coffee machine that doesn't even work etc... \\nWe will never set foot in this hotel again.

Lovely staff. Ideally located to get to Gare Montparnasse which is less than 10 minutes away on foot. Close to the Gait\\u00e9 metro.\\nIn the bathtub/shower, there was a grab bar that gave way when my son tried to catch himself so as not to slip. This grab bar was poorly fixed because it was too soaked with water at the ankles and tiles. As a result, it gave way and caused my son to fall.

The location is ideal with theatres and cinemas nearby, not to mention the many means of transport just a few minutes away. To come from CDG airport, the 20-minute walk from the Denfert-Rochereau RER is pleasant when you travel light.\\nIt would be great to have a coffee machine in the room, but I understand that waste is reduced by having coffee downstairs, at the machine in the foyer.\\nA tiny smile from the receptionists would have been the icing on the cake ;).\\n\\nComfortable room\\n\\nPractical formula with kitchenette!

Loved the view of the courtyard seeing the pop-up looking resturants and live size chess board. \\nWe loved that they had great restaurant recommendations and connections to get quick assess into the different restaurants\\nour first 2 nights the cleaning staff kept waking is up to clean the rooms, which on the 1st day was very annoying seeing that we only go into Paris and the hotel at a little over midnight.\\n\\nBreakfast and bed\\nToilet outside and noisy outside\\n\\nlocation\\nroom was small\\n\\nThe hotel is well situated for getting around Paris and is a quick metro ride to Gare du Nord for the Eurostar. Staff, facilities and room were very good, with a comfy bed and spacious room. Breakfast was delish and had something for everyone. It attracts business, family and solo travellers. Easy walking distance to the Pompidou centre and Marais shopping and dining area.\\nPlace de la Republique is a busy area and can attract some protests but it wasn\\u2019t disruptive staying at the hotel.\\n\\nThe staff\\nNothing comes to mind\\n\\nRoom was good, as was location and breakfast\\nWhen leaving the breakfast table to get more food, came back and found the table completely cleared.\\n\\nThe location and price\\nFor reasons of hygiene, I didn't like that the rooms and corridors still have carpeted floors.\\n\\nGenerally It is good.Breakfast was excellent. They have a small market online inside for drinks and snacks it was helpfull\\nGenerally Facility got old little bit. Some parts needs refurbishment for ex elevators.\\n\\nHotel staff were very helpful.\\n\\nrooms are big for Paris standart. We will stay again.\\n\\nI liked the lobby, the breakfast area, and the location. The staff was really polite and helpful.\\nThe initial room was terrible. It was in the second floor, internal and not sunny at all, and with a door which was supposed to connect with another room. We complained and they changed the room. They gave us one on the third floor with a view in the Plaza. I strongly recommend asking for a room with a view in the Plaza before booking!\\n\\nLovely old heritage hotel. Breathtaking location, good breakfast. Highly recommend\\nNoisy streets , probably due to it's location.\\n\\nGreat check in - fantastic attentive staff and great breakfast each day !\\n\\nvery good breakfast, fantastic staff\\n\\nAmazing staff, great facilities, central location to shops, restaurants, and couple minute walk to the river and lively streets behind the Republique.

Nice restaurant and cafes around this hotel.\\nThe water facilities were bit poor especially the sink.\\n\\nExcellent selection at breakfast. Service staff were prompt and friendly.\\nChoice of teabags in the room. I can't remember what they had but I remember not having tea because they had an odd (and limited) tea bags in the room. No English breakfast or green tea in the rooms. You could get it at breakfast though.\\n\\nThe three of them were very good.\\nThe taxi driver whom the hotel called to take us to the airport cheated us.\\n\\nStaff were amazing esp reception staff, bag handling.\\n\\nIt was friendly, warm and comfortable. The staff particularly Aida and Marc made us feel so welcome. The facilites are fantastic, as is the location. Will definitely stay here again when we next come to Paris.\\n\\nLocation.

I thought it was not as varied as before - I come to the hotel once or twice a year.\\n\\nThe staff were delightful: kind and helpful throughout.\\nThe food was not great.\\n\\nLocation was excellent, staff was really nice and helpful\\ud83e\\udd29\\n\\nLocation was amazing, 5 minutes from the office. Clean and hotel was lovely.\\nBar closed very early, met with colleagues and wanted after dinner drinks but bar was closed so we had to go find somewhere else. Bar was also quite expensive when it was open, so only had 1 drink there.\\n\\nLots of activities in the area. Close to most attractions\\nNothing really\\n\\ncentrally located\\nbreakfast could have been better.no Indian food options\\n\\nVery noisy location\\n\\nThe hotel is just 2mins walk from train station and lots of eatery places nearby.\\nThe hotel is very clean with comfortable beds. I had an excellent stay. Its near the Gare De Nord too.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast. Beautifully renovated. Right next to where we wanted to be. Right next to a Metro\\nA lot of running up and down the passageway one night.\\n\\nThe breakfast is very hearty, the service staff is very serious and enthusiastic, the transportation is very convenient, and the subway station is right outside the hotel door. I sometimes wake up in the morning to the sound of cars outside my window.\\nWindow sound insulation\\n\\ngood selection of breakfast and facilities\\nbasic baskets\\n\\nThe location is excellent, and also the staff! Breakfast is nice, variance of choices of food. We will stay here when come back to Paris in the future.\\nSound insulation is not very good.\\n\\nTerrific breakfast, as expected of Crowne Plaza hotels. I love that Crowne Plaza hotels cook omelettes to your liking and their pancakes are freshly made, not too sweet and nice and fluffy. Their fruit juice selection is freshly squeezed with pulp still evident and not reconstituted cordial. They provided ironing facilities in the room too. \\nOur room was suitable for the Accessibility impaired, and therefore was large and spacious and had high ceilings, which we loved, however that meant the bathroom was less luxurious with no counter space and water splashed everywhere.\\nA common room with coin operated laundromats would always be welcome, as they are impossible to find amongst hotels in Europe. In fact, the Crowne Plaza hotel in Australia in Hunter Valley, Lovedale provides a communal coin operated laundromat.\\n\\nIt was ok\\nThe fact that I check out a day earlier than my original reservation and I was not reimbursed for the day I did use the hotel. That for me was unfair considering that I have been in there previous hotels and booked the next one through booking.com, so I'm a regular user of your platform and that should be taken into account.\\n\\nproximity to metropolitan and quiet at night\\nproximity to republic square which saw congregations of groups of people lost evenings which were quite intimidating (especially for the kids)\\n\\ngood breakfast, clean and comfortable\\nUber cars not allowed outside the hotel, ok with normal taxis. no USB charge point in bedroom\\n\\nBreakfast was excellent. Varied choices, tables cleared quickly, food stocks replenished promptly\\nThere were no drawers for clothes in the room and nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. Water pressure in the shower was weak.\\n\\ngood location, very polite staff\\n\\nHelpful staff\\nNot applicable\\n\\nfriendly staff and good location The breakfast was good and the location was close to many amenities.\\nthere was no swimming pool\\n\\nBreakfast really good. Working area great\\nNothing to complain about\\n\\nThe hotel is in an ideal location plenty of restaurants, cafes etc in the Republicque area. All the staff we spoke to in the hotel were so lovely. Hotel clean..honestly i couldn't fault the room we stayed in or the restaurant Great breakfast choice. If you dont mind a good walk to the louvres , eifel tower etc it takes about 40 + minutes and it's enjoyable to see the surroundings. If im honest i would advise to get taxi back to the hotel if you spend day sightseeing near tower, cruise etc as you will enjoy your evening meal locally.\\nNothing really as the hotel was lovely. If you don't mind being a little bit outside where the eifel tower is etc the hotel is perfect as we enjoyed the 40 minute walk to the louvre.\\n\\nGreat staff. Offered me a free upgrade for the room with complementary drink as a honeymoon gift. They were helpful with luggage & restaurants reservations.\\nRoom's furniture was a bit old (but very clean and neat)\\n\\nEverything was perfect!!! The hotel was next to a Metro station that served many different train lines. The location was close to everything ( Marais next to us ) and at any time felt quite safe. We recommend it to famillies.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe breakfast is exceptional\\nFacilitiesThe hotel is advertised as 4star hotel, but its far from it , it's 3 stars at most\\n\\nAt first we got a room on 4th floor with 2 small windows under the ceiling. After complaining we got nice room with big window as it is on the pictures. Helpful and nice stuff, comfortable beds, great breakfast with variety of foods.\\nThere should be more hangers for towels in the bathroom. Sometimes at the breakfast some foods were not fresh - corn, friuts and fruit salads.\\n\\nThe staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole stay.\\n\\nLocation,clean\\nRoom is very small\\n\\nThe buffet breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of foods to suit all tastes. The hotel was very central with a metro station entrance just beside it. The staff were really pleasant and very helpful.\\n\\nSituated in a very noisey location, could not sleep at all with sirens passing by every few minutes.\\n\\neverything\\nThe attitude of the some of the staff. The cleaner and the person at the reception\\n\\nBreakfast was amazing!! Enjoyed our suite with our family! Loved the metro being right outside of the hotel. Staff were super nice and helpful with whatever we asked of them.\\nIt was really warm and we couldn\\u2019t seem to turn down the thermostat.\\n\\ngood location , helpful stuff comfortable rooms\\n\\nLocation on metro lines\\nMore cleaning in the room is necesary. Especially the bathroom, carpet and window. Check in was not friendly.\\n\\ngreat location, easy access via metro and walking.\\nfriendly staff and really big rooms.\\n\\nthe location was superb as the subway connects to many parts of Paris. the place is lovely with pleasant and helpful staff. the breakfast buffet was fantastic with lots to choose from.\\nnothing in particular\\n\\nClean, nice staff, excellent location, very good breakfast.\\nShower\\u2019s water pressure was OK but could be stronger.\\n\\nThe location, the room\\nthe crowded breakfast\\n\\nvery pleasant staff, fabulous location, easy to access the tourist sites by metro, great buffet breakfast (not included in our rate but no problem to access as required), free wifi, huge family room, very comfortable beds, plenty of interesting restaurants nearby\\u2026\\nsmall amount of cosmetic work required in the shower (loose tile)\\n\\nexcellent location, helpful and friendly staff, great breakfast\\n\\nlocation, spacious rooms, friendly staff, good breakfast\\n\\nperfect location, great breakfast\\n\\nFriendly staff, excellent location. Clean.\\nRoom for 4 is actually too small for 4. Next time I would not buy breakfast and instead have it at any of the bars or bakeries around the corner. Breakfast is not worth the money.\\n\\ngreat location, accessible to all locations from Repablique Metro station (Ave de Republique exit) just a few metres away from the hotel. very friendly staff. Lots of great restaurants around the area. The food in the hotel restaurant is also excellent.\\nthe rooms are small. but that's expected of Paris.\\n\\nAs far as Paris goes, location was good. Right next to a metro station\\nThe hotel is situated in a busy area. There was a lot of traffic noise, sirens, horns etc both late at night and early morning.\\n\\nFound the staff in all areas very helpful and friendly. There was a good brisk, efficient working atmosphere. Bight and clean environment. Breakfast had good variety.\\nI was concerned to see a young boy using the rather sharp knife for the parma ham! \\n\\nI'm afraid my biggest gripe is that on looking at my invoice en route to the airport I was shocked to see I had been charged for ordering taxis. First off we only ordered a taxi for two outings and when presented ourselves on time for them only to be told none available and had to go out on the street to hail one down! I also tipped the concierge - I'm angry to have been charged \\u20ac23.04 for asking for taxi - we should have been informed before hand there was a charge. It left a v sour taste after a nice break in an otherwise well run hotel - just smacked of gouging!\\n\\nThe location was perfect, view outside of window was amazing!\\nThe scents of the body lotion, shampoo, wash etc didn\\u2019t smell that nice.\\n\\nA good location, fair price, good restaurant\\nNo access to Wifi in our part of the building. Requested helped and was told someone was looking into it. The issue was never resolved.\\n\\nThe building was beautiful and the location was fantastic.\\nNothing in particular\\n\\nlocation - plenty of choice for eating around the lively square and metro station very close. \\nroom - very spacious suite. best ever sofa bed! \\nbreakfast - fabulous selection. \\nstaff - very friendly and helpful\\nonly complaint was thought the exec lounge needs relocating.

Room was spacious for 2 x adults and kids. Nice breakfast.\\nNo movies or kids channels on the TV.\\n\\nexcellent breakfast \\nbig rooms\\ncomfortable beds\\nhelpful and friendly staff\\nvery weak shower\\n\\nbig clean air conditioned rooms. great breakfast and lobby. very nice staff\\nnothing. a pool would be nice \\ud83d\\ude02\\n\\nVery well located and a very good breakfast\\nBeds weren\\u2019t comfy\\n\\nVery central, few steps from metro station. appears to have recently been renovated, pleasant and smiling helpful staffs.\\nWould recommend to have more variety on the menu at restaurant, catering for vegetarians and halal.\\n\\nBeautiful, well-kept rooms.\\nSmall complaint: there was nowhere to hang the towels.\\nLarge complaint: one of the reasons that we stayed there was for a large, beautiful courtyard in the middle of the building. 3 of the 5 nights we stayed, that courtyard was rented out to a corporate party. It is very large and could have easily been divided for hotel guest usage and rental usage, but we were not able to use it at all those nights.\\n\\ngood location. big room and we had wet room bathroom which was huge. great breakfast and helpful staff. temple area is worth exploring\\nnothing really\\n\\nlovely bar and great breakfast. staff were excellent.\\n\\nlocation excellent,\\nroom had no cupboards and insufficient hanging space. room very small\\n\\nGreat feel when you first arrive, very stylish and welcoming, staff very friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast\\nlunch options pricey and limited.\\n\\nLocation was great.

Lifts worked well and room was quiet.\\nBreakfast was good but staffing was inadequate. Tables weren\\u2019t cleared, crockery ran out and when someone asked to have a table cleared we heard the member of staff that they only had 4 staff to cater for 450 clients\\n\\nThe location was good\\nIt is very expensive for what you get. Additionally the breakfast was not very impressive for the price. The rooms are old and tiny.\\n\\nlocation\\nsofa beds were not comfortable\\n\\nThis is a standard corporate business hotel with a fantastic location and good value. For Paris standards, the hotel room is relatively larger than most hotel rooms in the city and the rooms are clean, have air conditioning, and have been recently renovated. It's a big hotel with lots of activity (tourists and conventions), so it's hard to experience personalized service.\\n\\nThe location of the hotel is prime and super convenient. The metro is just outside the hotel and Republique is a major metro hub. It's also very close to the desirable arrondisments of the Marais, Canal Martin etc.\\nWe asked for a quiet room, but our request was not accommodated. We got a room that faced the square....althought I will say, the windows are double pane and blocked out most of the noise.\\n\\nThe hotel is very well located\\nThe breakfast could be better and the staff could be friendlier. A shame that you feel like that you are disturbing them. Only Laure-Line and Sami were amazing !\\n\\nwe like that the rooms were very spacious and clean\\nthe area is a little noisy\\n\\nRoom was fine, front desk personal was very helpful & extremely nice!\\n\\nlocation was perfect.\\nthe room while comfortable was a bit run down and not enough closet space.\\n\\nlocation and generous room size\\nroom a little run-down, roof terras very nice but could be greener\\n\\nThe staff was wonderful.

The kids loved it so much!\\n\\nThe staff didn't know I was a rewards member. They didn't offer any of the membership benefits when I was checking in until I told them I was a Diamond member.\\n\\ncentra\\nnothing\\n\\nThe hotel is well located.\\nMy room was noisy and the customer service level extremely poor. Basic requests were set with an immediate no ( like an additional 30 mins for check out) also room amenities are extremely basic ( broken hair dryer and useless iron)\\n\\nHotel was situated in a great location! Republique Square is a very central point, where all subway lines meet and you can mainly get transferred anywhere in the city. Lounge area downstairs was really well designed, with an amazing bar and lots of tables to accommodate plenty of visitors and guests. Breakfast was also very good!\\nAlso after an online request to give us a room with a view, they tried their best and gave us a room with partial view of the Eiffel Tower. I thank them for that!\\nRooms are not too big and even though updated, they are not brand new. They changed few things within the room, to give it a more fresh vibe (like linens and some design pillows), but some pieces scream outdated. Carpet on the floor is a Huge No from me as well as the entry piece where the coffee machine and closet are placed. This built in furniture it's like it's forgotten from the 80's. Even though we paid for a deluxe double room, the room didn't seem like one. Overall the hotel lounge and lobby are completely renovated, but the rooms are not.\\n\\nBreakfast was fantastic. Location was excellent, we love this area and always stay in the area when in paris.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nBreakfast was perfect plenty of choice\\n\\nBreakfast was great. Location is very nice. Metro access is very close and there are lots of restaurants nearby.\\nThe fridge and the aircon in the room were not working. Some areas of the room and in the passages need maintenance.\\n\\nlocation, room, breakfast, staff\\n\\nClean, Suite was spacious, beds comfortable, location convenient. We were very comfortable so decided to stay longer.\\nWhen wanting to extend our stay reception directed us to go online and book it rather than process it for us. Club lounge not enough seats or food options.\\n\\nThe breakfast was complete, location was excellent.\\nWhen we asked for a plate and spoon in our room we were told it would be an additional charge.\\n\\nAlso we had to change our room as it was too hot.\\n\\nlocation was excellent\\nseemed to cater to large groups,\\n\\nPerfect location. Close to Metro station, 1 minute. The restaurant for breakfast is open until 11 a.m. in the weekend.\\nNo mini bar, old bathroom, small room for family - 2 adults and 2 kids.\\n\\nlocation was fantastic- metro just outside the door! Lots of family friendly restaurants around the square We loved the ping pong table on the terrace\\nbathroom\\u2019s a little dated, cracked tiles etc, breakfast wasn\\u2019t included in room price\\n\\ntop location. 3 stops with the metro to the city centre.\\n\\nLovely stay and a very friendly staff.\\n\\nShower could be better\\n\\nGood, relatively for Paris, comfortable big rooms.\\nBathroom is also very comfortable with a big bath. Very good and tasty breakfast with a big veriery of dishes. \\nLocation very near a main metro station. \\nStaff is very helpful and friendly\\nLocation on the republique square can be problematic sometimes. There are many demonstartions and police presence which cause discomfort when going out\\n\\nFabulous breakfast, wide range of choices including freshly cooked omelettes! Luggage storage was useful. Staff were all really helpful and welcoming giving recommendations for dinner etc.\\nOne of the reasons for booking this hotel was the fitness room but it was very small and could only really accommodate a couple of users at once. There was an outdoor table tennis table but no bats. More teabags/milk as standard in the room (only 2 provided) would be a nice touch.\\n\\nSpacious rooms, friendly staff\\nExec lounge a bit basic, hotel toilets a bit of a mess, couldn\\u2019t change language on TV\\n\\nThe breakfast was delicious and a special thank you to the chef who made the omelettes.\\nMy room was quite far from the lift.\\n\\nNice hotel, good bed, nice general areas\\nshower simple, you should expect a rain shower \\nroom was at the square side; direct above a podium for a manifestation with a lot (really) a lot of noice.. music, loud speakers.. hotel should have advise me upfront or give the choice for another location in the hotel\\n\\nStaff were nice and helpful.\\nIt can be noisy but that's the location.\\n\\nGreat location in the hart of the city next to metro, Excellent restaurants in walking distance. The rooms are not spoiling you with style & comfort, but there is good bed, fast WiFi, Great housekeeping, everything in the room and in the building is very clean, Good bar & kitchen, providing large choice in breakfast.\\nNo IHG award points & nights if you book through booking.com\\n\\nnice location and staff to book trips\\nno vending machines \\nMonoprix grocery store few blocks away\\n\\nGood location, friendly staff and very comfortable\\nSeparate toilet without a sink, no mirror except in the bathroom\\n\\nA lot of extra services and very comprehensive staff!\\n\\nGood location on R\\u00e9publique Square, just to metro station\\nThe service is not at a high level. The restaurant for a breakfast opened from 7 o'clock, which is strange for a business trip. There are better 4 star hotels in Paris\\n\\nLocation was great a few steps from the metro. 3 stops and 5 minutes from Gare du Nord. The entrance is through the archway. Bed room was largest I have had in Paris. Quality great. Free water every day. A few metro stops to Ile de Paris and quite easy to Eiffel Tour too and Sacre Coeur. Nice modern bar with food and views of square. Supermarkets to left and left and bar with breakfast to right and right for 7 Euros. Good choice of restaurants on the square. Interesting to see all the different protests\\nBreakfast was 15 euro prebooked or 25 on the day.\\n\\nExcellent breakfast included in the room rate, although I did not like the coffee at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\\nThe room was very small. There was very little space for our luggage.\\n\\nFriendly staff. Centrally located.\\nNo on-site parking\\n\\nlocation, having a gym and size of the rooms are great. and the breakfast is good too. the bar lost a bit of its appeal...its too bright now. lights could be dimmed down to make it cosier for a night drink.\\nthe hotel has become a bit expensive and forcing you to be charged in advance when could just have the first night guaranteed could be a better option for guests.\\n\\ngood location, nice staff\\ncould use some renovation, windows/balcony dirty\\n\\nParking is not easy...., breakfast, location and room great. Shower only point.\\nShower\\n\\nEven on a busy morning breakfast ran very smoothly.\\nIt might have been the Covid restrictions still in place, but the bar closed early at night.\\n\\nThe cleaning staff was nice\\nI recently had a disappointing stay at the Crowne Plaza, where I spent two weeks. Unfortunately, the internet connection in my room was consistently poor, forcing me to relocate to the lobby cafe to work.\\n\\nHowever, my experience at the cafe was equally frustrating. The staff frequently interrupted me during Zoom meetings, insisting that I make a purchase. As a business traveler relying on a stable and quiet workspace, I found this to be unacceptable.\\n\\nGiven the subpar internet and unwelcoming cafe atmosphere, I'm unlikely to return to this hotel. For the price point, I expect a more professional and accommodating environment. There are certainly better options available.\\n\\nRoom was excellent, location was fantastic and the breakfast was amazing\\nNothing\\n\\nSleep\\nAsked for courtyard room, confirmed at checkin, given a streetside room. No coffee maker in room, instant only.\\n\\njust breakfast\\nEVERYTHING \\nthe staff has no knowledge about whereabouts \\nwrong directions.\\ndidn't have any heat all over the stay.\\nthe room rugs were worn out \\nworn out decor and wall papers .\\nCamille the Assistant reception manger was just teying ro be nice so that we dont complain but did nothing about the Heat \\nthe night auditors were very rude and arrogant.\\nthe lady at the reception on our check out day had no sense of direction and gave us wrong itinerary.\\nAll together BAD EXPERIENCE\\n\\nThey were incredibly accommodating with our pets!\\nN/A we liked everything\\n\\nperfect location as there are shops, cafes and places to eat right outside the hotel. Also there is a metro station right outside\\ni think it is a bit overpriced\\n\\nThe Location and the the breakfast\\nCheck in and the checkout policy\\n\\nHotel is in a great location for both walking and taking the Metro. \\nThe daily breakfast was a perfect way to start the morning.\\nEveryone was so nice and accommodating.\\nHighly recommend.\\nWe liked everything.\\n\\nGreat location, warm, modern with old world charm. Breakfast was good, the restaurant staff at breakfast were very attentive.\\nComfortable beds, warm rooms.\\n\\nThe breakfast was absolutely lovely.\\nEverything was fresh and very delicious. \\nThe Staff at the restaurant were very friendly and attentive. We had a wonderful breakfast experience every day of our 7 day stay. We would like to mention how kind and sweet Joice was to my husband and I always greeting us with a smile.\\nThe location of the Hotel was perfect.\\nThe hotel rooms are small and would have been more comfortable if larger and dresser to unpack our clothes away.\\n\\nEverything- great location, service and experience!\\nN/A\\n\\nVery nice hotel and staff.\\nGrumpy bar tender\\n\\nclean\\nservices , drinks and food too expensive\\n\\nBreakfast was good. Location:noisy\\n\\nlocation. Friendly staff\\ncleanliness of the toilet. The sink in the shower is clogged and hair gathers on the floor. \\ni was misled by the publicity photo of a hotel housed in a grand building, but it lacks a proper entrance and the inside decor is like a YMCA property. The gym is too small.\\n\\nLocation, safety, quiet\\nAir conditioner wasn\\u2019t working, the room smelled of cigarettes, the bathroom drain was clogged, there were no amenities.\\n\\nWell located a short walk from the train station\\nRoom was not even close to those shown on the booking page. We got a disabled room for a romantic break that was tiny with the bathroom taking up the majority of the room. Bed was uncomfortable, outside was very noisy at night with one evening someone having the horn on none stop for 5 minutes at 4:20am. \\nBreakfast was the best point of the stay as we decided to spend the vast majority of our time away from the room. One meal in the hotel we had was very poor, hummus made with sesame oil was barely edible and the poke bowl was only just better. \\nRoom was dated and no coffee machine in a 4* hotel I was not sure still existed. \\n\\nOverpriced and certainly not 4* by some measure. Wont be back.\\n\\nThe location was fantastic. It\\u2019s within 50 m of the R\\u00e9publique Metro station and that has a number of metro lines to help you get to anywhere quickly. Breakfast was exceptional with something for everyone. Our rooms were very comfortable with excellent facilities. All staff were extremely friendly. Positioned on a rectangle with Place de la R\\u00e9publique in the centre, there were numerous bars and restaurants to sit and watch the world go by. We loved it!\\nIf I had to be picky, the only thing we didn\\u2019t like was the cost of the rooms and the cost of drinks and food at the hotel. However, this is an excellent hotel, in an excellent location, in Paris - so I wasn\\u2019t surprised at the expense.\\n\\nLocation\\nNothing\\n\\nBreakfast choices were fantastic - for all of the family. The location was great, right beside a metro station. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel was really clean. Staff were very friendly.\\nNothing.\\n\\nLarge hotel with reasonable amenities and good location\\nThe room was full of mosquitoes - I had to ask for it to be sprayed whilst we were out which improved it but only for one night- our whole family has mosquito bites from sleeping in the room - not what I expected for a 4 star expensive hotel- also the breakfast was advertised as being available at 6:30 but didn\\u2019t open til 7 which meant we couldn\\u2019t access it on our day of departure due to the early start to our day of travel despite having paid for it. Overall was ok but not what you should expect for a 4 star hotel in Paris.\\n\\nNot much to like.\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall). When I requested to change the room, they changed the room on the mezzanine floor, with windows to the sky. It is very bad filling when you arrive to the hotel and feel they lied from the first moment.\\nThere where mosquito in the room and we had to fight with them.\\nAt the and the most awful was that my 13 year old daughter\\u2019s shorts where lost/stolen. I talked to the r\\u00e9ception guys several times and no reaction. We knew that it was stolen on the 99% and they didn\\u2019t cared. On the last manager called and said that they were investigating and if it will not be found they will refund. But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nNot much to like\\nI have booked a standard family room for four. In fact they gave us a room with now view (View to the wall).

But the attitude was terrible.\\n\\nLoved the location close to lots of cafes and restaurants, on the metro and close to Gare de Nord. The family room was a great size, lots of space for 2 adults and 3 teenagers, and aircon worked well. There was a large courtyard terrace with outdoor games for the teens.\\nLovely hotel, no complaints\\n\\nLocation and room.\\nGreat bedroom with good crisp linen and comfortable mattress as well as a variety of pillows.\\nNothing to flag\\n\\nIt is in an amazing section of Paris with many restaurants. The R\\u00e9publique Metro station is right outside the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was such a time saver and had so many choices to get your day started. Also, the staff was so welcoming and friendly.\\nBecause of the Square right next to the hotel, don't expect it to be super quiet. Maybe some of the interior rooms would be more quiet. WIFI was also spotty in our room.\\n\\nPerfection\\nReally hard bed\\n\\nI had originally reserved one room with two large beds for my 2 daughters, one grandson and me. It worked out even better to have adjoining rooms, one with crib for the baby, one without. Location and comfort were very good. The receptionist who checked me out was kind, calm and professional, a warm send-off.\\nBased on my own experience, working in a 5-star hotel in Boston, I did not appreciate my initial check-in experience, before I realized a manager had modified my original reservation to the adjoining rooms. The receptionist made me feel like I had reserved 2 rooms, as if I'd made a mistake, 'that would be worked out later'. On my check-out morning, I also did not appreciate being made to feel like a criminal for bringing my 14-month-old grandson to the breakfast room before my daughter needed to leave to catch an early train. In general, I think a hotel of this caliber should not nickel & dime customers.\\n\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\nWhere do i begin everything about this hotel os horrible the rooms, windows and elevator everything is old and dirty - there is a general smell of sewage in the rooms and hallways because the building is old and they don't clean it well , it was my partners birthday and they couldn't even get us anything in the room because Room service doesn't exist.\\nThe staff was nice and felt sorry about everything they accepted everything was bad and horrible but they couldn't do anything about it , even one of them was like we know our hotel is horrible we're sorry for it.\\nSave your money and get another hotel this will be nothing but a disappointment for you \\n99% of the people who stay here are over 70 YEARS old it's like a sad dirty elderly house.\\nStay away\\n\\nGood location, close to different museums and historical places. Room spacious, clean and quiet. Good choices of food during breakfast.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe Air Conditioning in the room did not work for the duration of our stay. After repeated complaints and requests a table fan was sent. This is not acceptable especially when paying for an Air conditioned room. Also, the exhaust in the bathroom did not work.\\n\\nNear metro\\nHow unsafe I felt we turned in daily by 7pm homeless people and daily protesting and rally\\u2019s were the norm across the street which lead to uncertainty with my safety and my children\\n\\nNot much\\nNoisy, basic, bad location, disturbed numerous times by wake up alarm that wasn\\u2019t requested at 3am and housekeeping trying to get us out way before check out\\n\\nI think that that\\u2019s the best my experience\\nNothing\\n\\nThe staff were kind and the breakfast was good.\\nThe distance from the elevator to the room was too long, Wi-Fi was weak. The building was old and the toilet and bathroom were very small.\\n\\nFree upgrade- perfect for our family of 4. Staff very welcoming and breakfast was lovely. All facilities were very good and staff very welcoming and friendly.\\n\\nEverything\\nNothing\\n\\nVery nice hotel. Good location. Absolutely friendly and helpful front desk staff!\\n\\nPerfect location, very convenient for the use of metro. Great breakfast and clean&big rooms.\\nNothing\\n\\nThe location was perfect, metro right outside with lots of restaurants around. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Room was big, plenty of space for family of 4. We had a juliet balcony which was lovely. Breakfast was amazing, so fresh and delicious.\\nNothing, it was all great. \\nAlthough it's probably reasonable to note that Place de Republique is popular for protests and homelessness. We saw one protest and also on 2 evenings there was a food bank in the square. We didn't encounter any issues at all, and would go back to the same hotel again in the future.\\n\\nNice room great staff from cheakin to bar staff great breakfast\\nNothing\\n\\nWow! I was looking for somewhere nice for myself, husband and sons, somewhere near to Paris, a decent sized room. The room was large, clean and comfy. The staff were lovely!! Bonus fact, they uses this hotel in the TV series Modern Family when they came to Paris! The hotel has direct metro access to the front door, 20-30 mins into Paris. Get the navigo cards to travel, cheap and efficient. Each card can have 10 trips on and you can \\\"recharge\\\" them for more. They're a bit like oyster cards and can be got at the stations. The food at The Dix in the hotel was amazing! The steak was incredible!\\n\\nNothing\\nEverything\\n\\nThe staff were very helpful, the room was a great size & it was modern & the metro was right at our doorstep.\\n\\nThe location\\nThe cleanness of the place\\n\\naccess .. best customer friendly receiption and warmth\\nnothing\\n\\nThe staff were very helpful \\n\\nSpecially the receptionist Mr. Younes\\nNothing every thing was nice\\n\\nthe hotel was great the location was graet the metro was under the hotel center and beutifull place .\\nthe hotel was clean the stuff chang the shits every day.\\ni want to say good thing about aida she was very kind to my family we have flight at 2240 pm and i ask her when i can live the room she ask me when i want to live and she let us to stay until 1700 pm she was very kindnes and reliable that she gave us back the tax i hope there is many peopel like her.\\nPlease send her what i wrote on her\\neverithing was graet\\n\\nStaff was unfriendly.

By far the best staff at any hotel I\\u2019ve stayed at\\n\\nRooms are a good size, beds and pillows comfortable\\nThe area was a little rough and so much noise as our room faced the street. First night students protesting/rioting, next couple of nights the homeless and junkies screaming and fighting at 3am. \\nRooms are tired and outdated, bathrooms too. \\nFound breakfast a little poor and the bar/restaurant had no kids menu/meals etc \\nI think it\\u2019s a little overpriced for what you get but I guess that\\u2019s Paris\\n\\nLocation only\\n- the mattress of room 390 was too soft and oldish\\n- spider webs on the roof\\n- cabinet tremendously old\\n\\nFirstly, we got given a room with marks all over the wall, a broken blind that would not open, a broken TV and lamp. We requested to switch rooms, which was an improvement. But still not the standard we expected with the price. Unfortunately we were disappointed!\\n\\nLocation, amazing building, very relaxing , with charcter\\n\\nlocation\\nnot safe area, not clean at all, noise\\n\\nMy room was 437 and the views of the square were amazing. The celebration and parade for Carnival were a highlight. What fun!\\nI found the staff to be courteous, efficient, friendly and charming. I would recommend this hotel and especially this room.\\nBeautiful as the room was, the bathroom needs a little attention to detail in the repair of some of the tile around the shower, some mold in the shower, and some little touch ups to the paint.\\n\\nStaff was excellent, provided helpful dinner suggestions and spoke excellent English (and didn't laugh when I tried to speak French). The facility was perfectly located and easily accessible. The rooms were clean as well.\\nThe on-site breakfast was a little pricey for us, but instead we just enjoyed local bakery items.\\n\\nThe breakfast was delicious\\nNothing\\n\\nspacious Room\\nSmart tv not connected for Netflix etc. 5 UK tv channels didn\\u2019t work. No hairdryer socket near a mirror. Lots of building noise when staff were cleaning rooms in the morning. Room doors slam shut, so very noisy.

Really well located.\\nWe absolutely wanted an air-conditioned hotel. This one was indicated as being. Arriving late in the evening, we were surprised by the heat that reigned in the hall. In the room that had windows overlooking the interior patio, it was worse. When we wanted to turn on the air conditioning, we noticed that it was not cold at all. On the contrary, the air blown is hot. We try to fall asleep, without success. We end up calling reception. After making excuses that would have made you fall asleep standing up to explain the non-functioning such as \\\"these are mandatory environmental measures\\\" they lent us a fan with a built-in thermometer. The temperature indicated 26\\u00b0. The next day, we went to ask for an explanation. We were finally told that the instructions given by management were not to operate the air conditioning. Probably to save electricity. But this is unacceptable for an establishment that claims 4 stars. It is false information to present itself as an air-conditioned hotel. We spent 2 very bad nights sleeping badly. \\nAdded to this a very slow reception staff, a kind of latent \\\"I don't care\\\" attitude, a coffee machine that doesn't even work etc... \\nWe will never set foot in this hotel again.
