(+) Very nice staff and location but long waiting time to get things checked in, lining up for breakfast the first day took for ages despite no que and plenty of free tables. Second day was better but still something we remember and it feels a little annoying hence the relative high price of the room.
(-) 1) House keeping ( always something missing).
2) toilet design ( why is the sink at the room entrance outside the toilet ?!)
3) room view (zero privacy)

(+) O HOTEL muito bem localizado no coração de Saint-Germain, equipe muito gentil falavam até algumas palavras em português. Café da manhã honesto.
(-) Achei poucas frutas frescas no café da manhã. E você deve pedir um up- grade do quarto pois o básico é muito pequeno.

(-) Las almohadas y la habitación exterior. A pesar de los esfuerzos del recepcionista por encontrar una, siempre muy de agradecer, increíble que no haya en el hotel una almohada lógica. Otro aspecto negativo es la dalta de aislamiento acústico de las ventanas. Es un barrio con mucho movimiento y vida nocturna, por lo que de noche puede ser molesto. La principal función de un hotel es tener un lugar para dormir, cosa que este viaje no he podido hacer muy bien.

(+) Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Great location close to cafes and metro. Beautiful hotel and large room.
(-) Our shower leaked out the bottom of the door onto the bathroom floor which just made us feel badly for getting the floor wet when we showered. More of an inconvenience for housekeeping I would imagine.

(+) The location was wonderful. Right in the heart of great restaurants in a very busy part of the Marais. The room was very spacious and quiet, on the sixth floor at the back of the hotel. The decor was lovely.
(-) It is certainly a surprise to see this is a five star hotel. There is no help with luggage. It seemed stingy. No little extras offered. No real service. The breakfast was very ordinary for the price, again with no service. We only had it on one day choosing to eat out on days. The doors on shower and toilet are water damaged and don’t close.

(+) O hotel é pequeno, bem localizado. A cama é confortável e as roupas de cama e banho tem ótima qualidade.
(-) A recepcionista que fez o check in é rude, parece que não faz questão de auxiliar. O chuveiro inundava todo o banheiro! Foi preciso colocar toalhas de banho para secar o piso pois a quantidade de água era enorme.

(+) Le camere sono abbastanza piccole ma di buon gusto e funzionali, con divanetto, tavolino, frigobar, macchina del caffè etc.
Molti graditi i macaron offerti all'arrivo.
Letto grande e comodissimo.
La posizione è strategica per visitare buona parte del centro partendo a piedi dall'hotel. Per le zone a ovest c'è una stazione della metropolitana a cinque minuti.
(-) Il bagno è un po' sacrificato (ricavato dal corridoio). In particolare si sente la mancanza di un posto dove appendere gli asciugamani. Grande e ben fatta invece la doccia.

(+) Ok so... I believe in good research before choosing the perfect hotel. This time, I'm happy I succeeded in my selection.
Superb hotel, great helpful staff, the room was clean and had everything we needed.
BTW, the bed was amazingly comfortable.

We enjoyed our vacation and enjoyed Paris, some of it is because of this hotel.
Best 4 star hotel in my opinion.
(-) no way to heat the room. Their centralized system is either cooler or heater. at mid season, it was on cooler and I had to ask for a portative heater... I would expect to select a temperature in such a high cost hotel.
the room was really stinky (like if a cat had pooped in the past).

(-) wir hatten ein sehr kleines Zimmer mit Mini Bett für 2 Personen. haben dann gefragt ob sie eine Alternative haben aber es hat ewig gedauert, am nächsten Tag haben wir die Situation dann der neuen Schicht erklärt die von ihren Kollegen nix wusste und so ging es die 3 Nächte dahin. Kommunikation unterm Team war nicjt vorhanden. 
ebenso wurde uns x mal versprochen das sie mit dem Manager sprechen aber es gab nie eine Rückmeldung. wir wollten beim auschecken 2 Rechnungen haben weil wir die Tage aufteilen wollten (hatten wir bereits bei Check in angegeben) aber auch das war ein großes Chaos und nur schwer machbar. Nach dem auschecken haben wir noch x mal angerufen damit wir die richtigen Rechnungen erhalten. sehr Unprofessionelle für ein sofitel!

(+) The hotel exceeded all of our expectations. This may be the most perfect, charming boutique hotel in all of Paris. We loved the rooms, especially the fabric on the walls, the decor--just perfect. Very comfortable beds. The espresso bar in the lobby was a special treat as we'd come in from a chilly rainy day. Our favorite part was the concierge, Sanjay. He was so knowledgable, so helpful, so kind and friendly. Our trip to Paris was a last minute decision with not much planning. Sanjay went out of his way to tell us the best restaurants, places to shop, and ways to get around the city. We will certainly be back to this hotel.

You walk out of the hotel and you’re in a festive, lively, cozy little part of town. Almost all of our favorite restaurants were within two blocks. Merci Paris et Hotel de Buci! I was very sad to go.

i have stayed at this hotel before paying for the same level of accomodation and our room was much bigger… i had to slip through the bathroom door to use it. and with two suitcases you could barely squeeze around the bed

Il dispose d'un jardin verdoyant d’exception, où le restaurant Maison Revka vous invite à déguster une cuisine raffinée en plein air sur une terrasse typiquement parisienne, à l'ombre des arbres.

Offrant une vue sur le jardin privé ou sur la rue, toutes les chambres disposent d'un auvent, dans un style alliant modernité et élégance. Vous disposerez de la climatisation, de peignoirs, de chaussons, d’un coin salon et d’une salle de bains en marbre.

Un parking est accessible à proximité, et l’hôtel assure un service de voiturier. Sur place, vous trouverez également une salle de sport.","(+) Très gentil! L’équipe de l’hôtel est chaleureux! Toute la famille est satisfaite pour ce voyage. Le petit déjeuner buffet est top!
(-) Il n'y a pas de parking. Un service voiturier est annoncé mais j'ai moi-même garé ma voiture devant l'hôtel et elle a passé la nuit au même endroit. Cet emplacement est facturé 45 euros.... C'est un peu exagéré.

(-) The hotel needs an upgrade. The elevator needs to be fixed, we changed a room that was right next to elevator because of the scratch noise it was making. Then in another room, the air conditioner was making leaking noise we had to call reception to fix this.

(-) Taras, z którego względu zarezerwowałyśmy ten hotel, był w remoncie, więc już na początku spotkało nas spore rozczarowanie (nie otrzymałyśmy przed przyjazdem żadnej informacji o pracach na dziedzińcu). Łazienka - szyby przy wannie nie można było do końca przysunąć, przez co podczas prysznicowania się zalewało się łazienkę; toaleta w osobnym pomieszczeniu, ale bez kranu - co to ma wspólnego z higieną? Śniadanie - nikt nie zaproponował nam przygotowania omleta/jajka, a z informacji na stoliku wynikało, jakby trzeba było za to dodatkowo płacić (w rzeczywistości niekoniecznie); nie donoszono produktów, które się kończyły (np. boczek, smażone warzywa), trzeba było się prosić o bagietkę; w ostatni dzień z powodu wczesnego wylotu poprosiłyśmy o śniadanie na wynos - tylko w jednej torbie było picie (sok), jedzenie bardzo nierówno rozłożone (w jednym 2 ciastka, 1 jogurt, banan, a w drugim 3 ciastka, 3 jogurty + po równo po jabłku i kiwi). Nie podróżuję po Europie zbyt wiele, więc może też nie znam standardów, ale każdorazowe podpisywanie się na rachunku na śniadaniu lub pobranie kaucji za każdy dzień pobytu w hotelu uważam za brak zaufania w stosunku do klienta i mnie osobiście to ubodło. Wydaje mi się, że hotel nie jest wart swojej ceny.

Nie podróżuję po Europie zbyt wiele, więc może też nie znam standardów, ale każdorazowe podpisywanie się na rachunku na śniadaniu lub pobranie kaucji za każdy dzień pobytu w hotelu uważam za brak zaufania w stosunku do klienta i mnie osobiście to ubodło.

(+) perfect location, good sized and clean rooms, very helpful and welcoming staff, very good breakfast
(-) While this hotel is excellent for seeing the major attractions, it is in a very expensive part of Paris. Breakfast was expensive for what you received. For a longer stays, the rooms lack a place to unpack your clothes. At this price point, it would be nice not to have to live out of your suitcase for 6 nights.

(+) great location. room size was good only downside we had ordered a taxi for 8 pm because staff said that wound be plenty of time. 10 minutes later I called the desk and asked that the taxi be changed to 7:45 to allow time for traffic and make sure we got to the Pont Neuf for the seine river cruise. unfortunately when we arrived in the lobby at 7:45 we were informed that they found not change the taxi time. this was extremely frustrating as an hour AB’s a hair had gone by from the time I requested the change and when we arrived in the lobby. if they weren’t able to change the taxi time they should have called back to the room and told us. we could have easily walked there had we been told. we almost missed the cruise but i stressed the entire taxi ride there. we got in the boat at 8:14 and the boat left promptly at 8:15 as scheduled.

(-) Poor quality hotel room; very dated. Not worth the price. No proper air conditioning system. When I complained, they just sent up a fan which was not much help either. Housekeeping was not efficient. Did not place new hand towels, bathroom floor mat/towel, and complimentary drinking water and coffee. We always had to request. It felt like we were at a 2-star hotel, not 4.

(+) La ubicación del hotel
(-) Realice una reservacion por Booking para 6 personas, al llegar al hotel no existia una habitacion con esa capacidad y el personal del hotel amablemente me consiguio una nueva reservacion por un solo dia. Nos alojamos en 2 habiataciones pero solo pude estar un dia en el Hotel, aun cuando tenia previsto estar 3 dias, y luego tuve que buscar un nuevo hospedaje que fue dificil porque estaba con 4 ninos. El Error fue de Booking.

(+) A localização é excelente, a limpeza do quarto era ótima e a camareira muito gentil.
(-) Achamos que a conservação do hotel deixou muito a desejar. Quarto com carpete manchado, calefação que oscilava muito a temperatura, pia do banheiro rachada. Ninguém ajudava para subir ou descer as malas, mesmo tendo funcionários livres. Para o padrão Melia que conhecemos, achamos que deixou a desejar. Custo benefício ruim.

(+) The location of the hotel was exactly where we wanted to be, surrounded by facilities such as restaurants, bars, shops and access to other areas of Paris, either walking or by Metro. By walking you see how the French people live.
(-) Nothing really. We have been going to Paris for many years now and we love the ways of French people. They have the attitude of live and let live and are no trouble at all. Everyone we meet wants to speak English because it means a better employment.

(+) Room was very comfortable, still big enough to stay with 2 small kids (they slept in a bed sofa). Breakfast was very complete, with tasty food and very pleasant and willing people, trying to make sure we had everything we wanted. 
Remaining common facilities of the hotel were also very comfortable
(-) It's not something bad, but a possibility to allow guests to go the Gym or Complete spa nearby (as hotel does not have it), would be good. Other then this, our stay was very good

(+) Sinceramente o menos decepcionante para um Hotel 5 estrelas foi o cafe da manhã, que apesar de encerrar as 10:30, cheguei um dia as 10:15 e a recepcionista mandou eu ser bem rápida.
A gerente depois da minha reclamação tentou ser educada demais, quando disse que iria avaliar o Hotel em todos os sites.
(-) Começar por um Hotel cinco estralas, que pode ser avaliado como 4. 
Pelo valor ja fiquei em outros bem melhores em Paris pelo mesmo preço.
As fotos do Booking não condiz com a realidade.
Nao existe quarto com a foto da torre.
Na foto o ângulo parece ser o dobro do tamanho que é. Quando falei para a gerente ela disse que esse quarto era o que paguei, e falei que ele não condiz com a foto. Ela disse que iria verificar no site as fotografias. 

Vamos para o sofa cama, minha filha que pesa 30 kilos esta com dor no corpo todo. O colchão do sofa cama completamente torto.

Nao indico esse Hotel.
Por essa tarifa existem Hoteis em Paris infinitamente melhores e mais bem localizados.
Obrigado

(+) No question about that this hotel is in the great location(heart of Champs Elysees) especially if you were planning for the New Year eve count down in Paris around Arc de Triomphe. The staffs were polite and professional. They let us ahead of time to get new year eve arrangement done. A free champagne for new year eve was a great addition from the staff.
(-) However, this hotel charged a lot but the room was not very clean (floor was worn and old) and also the details were not there like one of the phone did not work, standing shower rod was kind of broke, and the bed mattress was not in a good shape. We have a teenage traveling with us and we told the hotel ahead of time. However, I have to call the service to get enough towels for three persons. Overall, I was a bit disappointed on the value of the room vs what I paid.

(+) The staff were great, super kind. They would make purée for our 6 months baby every morning, which is amazing. 
The location is perfect for shopping.
(-) The rooms were a bit small, the bathroom is huge but the room itself isn’t too big.

(-) Не очень вкусные завтраки. С питанием вообще как то сложно в отеле. Все дни пока мы были ресторан не работал. Работал сервис бар и доставка в номер еды. Но еда была очень простая. Например мы заказывали лапшу с азиатским соусом, нам принесли быстрорастворимую лапшу залитую кипятком, серьезно!

(+) This is a truly magical chateau but in the heart of Paris! The interior is beautiful Art Deco and entirely reminiscent of a bygone era of grand hotels. The bar is ideal in every sense. The restaurant is both beautiful and great for breakfast and for dinner a high end experience. The staff of the hotel go above and beyond, and the concierge will solve all your worries in the world. The absolute best concierge. I forget their names but all three were amazing. Especially the most senior gentleman. The best!!

The restaurant is both beautiful and great for breakfast and for dinner a high end experience. The staff of the hotel go above and beyond, and the concierge will solve all your worries in the world. The absolute best concierge. I forget their names but all three were amazing. Especially the most senior gentleman. The best!!
